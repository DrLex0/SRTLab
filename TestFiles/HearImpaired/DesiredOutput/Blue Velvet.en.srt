00:01:49,025 --> 00:01:50,818
TEST FILE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY.
NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

2
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,502
It's a sunny, woodsy day in Lumberton,
so get those chainsaws out.

3
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:17,839
This is the mighty W-O-O-D,
the musical voice of Lumberton.

4
00:04:18,007 --> 00:04:19,841
At the sound of the falling tree...

5
00:04:21,886 --> 00:04:24,304
...it's 9:30!

6
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:28,225
There's a whole lotta wood
waitin' out there, so let's get goin'.

7
00:04:54,168 --> 00:04:55,669
Mr. Beaumont?

8
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:58,463
Your son Jeffrey's here to see you.

9
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:11,727
Hey, Dad.

10
00:07:08,261 --> 00:07:10,804
Do you have a Detective Williams
still working here?

11
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,473
Yes, he's up in room 221.

12
00:07:13,641 --> 00:07:15,142
Right up the stairs, through that door.

13
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:16,351
Thanks.

14
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,118
Detective Williams?

15
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:40,667
Yes?

16
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:44,838
My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near
you. I believe you know my father Tom?

17
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,424
- Beaumont's Hardware Store?
- Sure I do.

18
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,967
I hear he's in the hospital.

19
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,054
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.

20
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,640
They're doing tests.
That's why I'm home from school.

21
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,309
I was at the hospital this morning

22
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,313
and, coming home through
the field behind Vista,

23
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,399
I, uh... found an ear.

24
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,736
You did? A human ear?

25
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,071
Yeah. I thought
I should bring it to you.

26
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,200
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look at it.

27
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,624
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

28
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,044
Let's see what the coroner makes of it.

29
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,922
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

30
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,423
All right.

31
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,180
We'll check the morgue records, but I
don't recall anything minus an ear.

32
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,725
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

33
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,102
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

34
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,605
Once the tests are done, quite a lot.

35
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,901
Sex, blood type,
whether the ear came off a dead person.

36
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,656
Also, it looks like
the ear was cut off with scissors.

37
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,064
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

38
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,108
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

39
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,652
You're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

40
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,863
No, just around the neighborhood.
Don't worry.

41
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,449
OK, honey.

42
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:54,194
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
Is Detective Williams here?

43
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,073
- Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks.

44
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,416
Well, Jeffrey, you found
something very interesting.

45
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,128
Very interesting. I know you must
be curious to know more.

46
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,175
But I have to ask you not only
not to tell anybody about your find,

47
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,928
but also not to ask more about the case.

48
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,473
One day when it's all sewed up,

49
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,433
I'll let you know all the details.

50
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,727
Right now, though, I can't.

51
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:32,273
I understand.
I'm just real curious, like you said.

52
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,944
I was the same way myself when I was your age.

53
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,116
- That's what got me into this business.
- Must be great.

54
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,993
It's horrible, too.

55
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,039
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

56
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,835
Anyway, I know you do understand.

57
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,461
Sure.

58
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,969
- Thanks for the card for Dad.
- You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

59
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,554
You, too.

60
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,727
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

61
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,981
- Good night, Jeffrey.
- Good night.

62
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,371
Are you the one that found the ear?

63
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,184
How did you know?

64
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,899
I just know, that's all.

65
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,612
- I remember you from Central.
- Are you a senior?

66
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,696
Yup.

67
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,365
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

68
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,827
- I don't know... boring.
- What else is new!

69
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,537
So what are you doin' now?

70
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,207
I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

71
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,542
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

72
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,920
What do you know about the ear?

73
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,632
- Didn't Dad say not to talk about it?
- Yeah, but you brought it up.

74
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,133
You know anything?

75
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,137
I don't know much but bits
and pieces. I hear things.

76
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,889
Yeah?

77
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,225
My room is above my father's office so...

78
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,393
Above your father's office?

79
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,980
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

80
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,235
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

81
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,238
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

82
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,741
She lives in an apartment
real close to your house.

83
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,244
Close to the field where you found the ear.

84
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,205
It's a strange world, isn't it?

85
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,291
- Yeah.
- Where is this apartment?

86
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,086
It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

87
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,088
They had her under surveillance,

88
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,509
'cept I don't know what they found out
'cause she's not my dad's case. So...

89
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,638
I guess you gotta get
back home pretty soon, huh?

90
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,682
Not really. Why?

91
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,725
Well, uh...

92
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,020
- You... wanna see the building.
- Yeah.

93
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,815
- Come on, I'll show you.
- OK.

94
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,612
Hey, baby! Hey, babe!

95
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,325
That's her building right there.

96
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,453
She lives on the seventh floor.

97
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,087
Come on.

98
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,188
So, uh... what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

99
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,317
Help out at my father's hardware store.

100
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,028
They're giving me my own hours, which is nice.

101
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,742
I used to know a kid that lived there.

102
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,536
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

103
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,624
What happened to him?

104
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,086
I don't know. He moved away.

105
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,088
All my old friends are gone.

106
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,848
- You know the chicken walk?
- What's that?

107
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,522
That's kind of interesting.

108
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,962
Coffee time.
Yo!

109
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,340
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

110
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:12,220
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,
where they've always been.

111
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,722
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

112
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,225
Four.

113
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,728
I still don't know how you do that.

114
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,066
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

115
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,070
If you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

116
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,114
Okey-dokey, Double Ed.

117
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,575
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

118
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,683
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

119
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,352
I don't know.

120
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,563
I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.

121
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,357
Wait just a minute.

122
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,945
Listen. Don't you guys
dare say anything to Mike.

123
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,781
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, OK?

124
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,284
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

125
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,124
- I don't wanna cause trouble.
- I'm here, aren't I?

126
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,543
- He is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

127
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,966
You ever been to Arlene's?

128
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,385
Of course.

129
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,650
Now are you gonna tell me why we're here?

130
00:17:55,574 --> 00:18:00,119
There are opportunities in life
for gaining knowledge and experience.

131
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,082
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

132
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,796
I'll bet someone could learn a lot
by getting into that woman's apartment.

133
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,757
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

134
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,344
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

135
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,554
Are you crazy?

136
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:23,226
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in
murder. This is givin' me the creeps.

137
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:27,146
Now just settle down.
I have a plan which I think will work.

138
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,191
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

139
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,277
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

140
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,616
Tell me any plan you want, but it's not
going any further than this diner.

141
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,119
Sandy,

142
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,204
don't take that attitude.

143
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,669
All right. The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

144
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,673
- and open a window to crawl into later.
- How are you gonna do that?

145
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,926
Right out in the car
I happen to have some old overalls

146
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,553
and a bug-spraying rig.

147
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,140
I will go to her apartment
as a pest-control man.

148
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,975
I will spray her apartment.

149
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,854
You knock on the door, draw her
attention away from me,

150
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,814
and I'll jimmy a window.

151
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,902
- And what do I say to her at the door?
- You will be a Jehovah's Witness.

152
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,613
I have some Awake! magazines for you.

153
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,327
I don't need very much time,
just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?

154
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,164
I don't know.

155
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,836
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

156
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,425
- It's too dangerous.
- Sandy, let's just try the first part.

157
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,556
No one will suspect us.

158
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,602
No one would think two people like us
would be crazy enough to do this.

159
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,647
You have a point there.

160
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,287
Give me at least three minutes.

161
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,291
I can stall if it's more, but I need
time to find a good window. All right?

162
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,127
All right.

163
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,213
Let's go.

164
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,477
Here I go.

165
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,855
Wait a minute. What's her name?

166
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,149
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

167
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,402
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

168
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,490
Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy.

169
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,826
Thanks.

170
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,996
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

171
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,167
OK. Good luck.

172
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,419
Good luck yourself.

173
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,131
Three minutes. No sooner.

174
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,532
Yes? What is it?

175
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,785
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

176
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,292
- That stuff stinks.
- This is new stuff. There's no smell.

177
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,794
Good.

178
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,934
Just need to do the kitchen.

179
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,880
Grand Central Station!

180
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,688
- It's only the bug man.

181
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,593
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

182
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,603
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What happened?

183
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,856
I was about to go to the door
when that guy did it for me.

184
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,901
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

185
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,071
I only saw his back. I think he went out
a door at the end of the hall.

186
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,158
I didn't get a good look at him either,
but he sure looked at me.

187
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,746
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?

188
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,998
Yeah, if they open the door.

189
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,583
Yeah.

190
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,143
So, what's next?

191
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,232
- Are you game for more?
- I owe you one

192
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,275
since I goofed this one up.

193
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,321
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

194
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,787
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

195
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,291
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

196
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,587
Yeah. I do.

197
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,805
Well, that does that.

198
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,073
- You really wanna do this, don't you?
- I don't want you to get involved.

199
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,867
I do, but if something went wrong...

200
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,203
Like you said, they may be involved in murder.

201
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,504
OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

202
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,092
Just so the record is kept straight, though,

203
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,344
I love Mike.

204
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,016
What do you want me to do?

205
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,022
First we'll have a really nice dinner.

206
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,399
Try to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.

207
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,527
I already know.
The Slow Club on Route 7.

208
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,821
Great. I'll pick you up about eight?

209
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,074
Don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

210
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,579
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

211
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,081
You better get out before someone sees us.

212
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,841
See ya!

213
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,455
Wait. Here's to an interesting
experience, huh?

214
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,248
I'll drink to that!

215
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,383
Man, I like Heineken!
You like Heineken?

216
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,554
- I never really had Heineken before.
- You never had Heineken before?

217
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,598
My dad drinks Bud.

218
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,687
- King of beers.
-  Ladies and gentlemen,

219
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:14,024
the Blue Lady, Miss Dorothy Vallens.

220
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:18,941
- Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

221
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:24,029
'Cause it's crazy... and dangerous.

222
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,741
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

223
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,744
I don't think you should stay.
I think you should go home.

224
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,412
Can you drive this car?

225
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,666
- Yeah, but I...
- Leave it in front of your house, OK?

226
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,252
OK.

227
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,505
I'll see ya tomorrow
and I'll tell ya how it went.

228
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,842
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

229
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,680
- Mike's coming over.
- OK. Um... can I call you?

230
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,308
OK, yeah, call.

231
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,811
I hope you sneak out OK.

232
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,443
- I'm gonna wait here until she comes.
- Sandy...

233
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,779
I'm gonna honk four times.

234
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:10,951
I'll go one, two, three, four,
and then you'll hear it

235
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,037
- and you'll know she's on her way up.
- OK.

236
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,002
I don't know if you're
a detective or a pervert.

237
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,590
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

238
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,106
See ya.

239
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,858
Bye.

240
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,376
Heineken.

241
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,653
I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.

242
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,634
Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow.

243
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,302
- OK, good night.
- Good night.

244
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:31,545
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?
Frank, let me talk to him.

245
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,381
Please, Frank... sir.

246
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,219
I like to sing "Blue Velvet".

247
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,266
Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry.

248
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,519
Don! Don, can you hear me?

249
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,813
Is little Donny all right?

250
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,567
Is he there with you?

251
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,404
Don?

252
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,996
You mean Meadow Lane? Frank!
Frank, what's the matter with him?

253
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,834
I know. I'll be sweet.

254
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,754
Mommy loves you.

255
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,259
OK, Frank... sir.

256
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,015
Get out of there! Get out!

257
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,393
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

258
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,604
Get on your knees! Do it!

259
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,523
What are you doing?

260
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,902
- Who are you? What's your name?
- Jeffrey.

261
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,363
- Jeffrey what?
- Jeffrey nothing.

262
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,160
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet!

263
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:01,171
Jeffrey Beaumont. What are you doing
in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

264
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,841
- I wanted to see you.
- Are you kidding?

265
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,594
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

266
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,348
- I've seen you before.
- I sprayed your apartment.

267
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,601
I took your key. I didn't mean
to do anything except see you.

268
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,937
What did you see, tonight?

269
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,939
Tell me!

270
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,108
I saw you come in, talk on the phone...

271
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,153
- And then?
- You got undressed.

272
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,450
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

273
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,036
No, never before this.

274
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:38,333
- Get undressed. I want to see you.
- Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

275
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,211
No way! I want to see you!
Get undressed!

276
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,688
Stand up.

277
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,413
Come closer.

278
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,924
Closer.

279
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,476
What do you want?

280
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,272
I don't know.

281
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,581
Don't move. Don't look at me.

282
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,970
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

283
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,058
Don't touch me! Or I'll kill you!

284
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,562
Do you like talk like that?

285
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,148
No.

286
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,819
Get over there on that couch.

287
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,285
Lie down.

288
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,057
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Hide in the closet.

289
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,393
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

290
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,594
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

291
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,639
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

292
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,812
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

293
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,327
Now it's dark.

294
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,379
Spread your legs.

295
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,058
Wider.

296
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,646
Now show it to me.

297
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,044
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

298
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,783
Mommy...

299
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,211
Mommy! Mommy!

300
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,756
- Mommy...
- Mommy loves you, Frank.

301
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,967
Baby wants to fuck!

302
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,766
All right, get ready to fuck!
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

303
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,604
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

304
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,207
Baby... wants blue velvet.

305
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,567
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

306
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,075
- Look at me. Daddy's coming home.

307
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,747
Daddy's comin' home.

308
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,376
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

309
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,715
Daddy's comin' home.

310
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,846
Daddy's comin' home.

311
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,475
Daddy's coming home.

312
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,186
Daddy's coming home.

313
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,188
Daddy's coming...

314
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,524
Mommy! Mommy!

315
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,253
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

316
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,049
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

317
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,236
Now it's dark.

318
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,877
You stay alive, baby.

319
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,215
Do it for Van Gogh.

320
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,626
Why don't you lie down?

321
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,005
Come on, I'll help you.

322
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,725
I don't like that.

323
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,685
What do you want?

324
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,729
Nothing.

325
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,690
Are you all right?

326
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,987
Yeah, I'm all right.

327
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,491
I'm all right.

328
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,076
I'll go, then.

329
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,330
Don?

330
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,332
- Oh, Don!
- No...

331
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,668
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

332
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,339
I'm scared. I'm scared.

333
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,591
I'm scared!

334
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,636
It's OK. It's OK.

335
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,555
Don? Don?

336
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,476
Are you back?

337
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,404
Do you like me?

338
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,119
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

339
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,089
Do you like the way I feel?

340
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,216
Yes.

341
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,600
See my breast?

342
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,563
You can feel it.

343
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,696
My nipple is getting hard.

344
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,199
You can touch it.

345
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,790
You can feel it.

346
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,836
Do you like the way I feel?

347
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,256
Yes.

348
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,593
Feel me.

349
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,683
Hit me.

350
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,479
- Dorothy, no. Stop it.
- Hit me.

351
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,356
Hit me.

352
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,233
Hit me!

353
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,398
I'm leaving now.

354
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,152
Don.

355
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,156
Don.

356
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,243
Help me.

357
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,312
Oh, my God. That hat.

358
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,608
She's married.

359
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,652
"Don."

360
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,454
Help me.

361
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,916
Now it's dark.

362
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,086
Hit me. Hit me.

363
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,722
Man, oh man.

364
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,564
- Sandy, can ya talk?
- Mike's here.

365
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,817
Oh. I guess I'll talk to you later,
then.

366
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:20,696
- Well, how'd it go?
- It went OK. I'll tell you about it.

367
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,198
I'll pick you up at eight.

368
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,452
New axe, 48721.

369
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,413
Twenty-two...

370
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,166
...ninety-five.

371
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,503
- I'll see ya then.
- OK, great.

372
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,255
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

373
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,461
Well?

374
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,714
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

375
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,218
OK.

376
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,558
It's a strange world, Sandy.

377
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,859
Dorothy Vallens is married, to a man named Don.

378
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,487
They have a son.

379
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,994
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

380
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:54,290
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

381
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,459
I think she wants to die.

382
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,257
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

383
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,217
as a warning for her to stay alive.

384
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,722
Frank is, uh...

385
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,727
...a very dangerous man.

386
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,771
My God.

387
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:23,527
- Shouldn't you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

388
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,907
I can't prove any of this.
I found out my information illegally.

389
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,576
You could get into a lot of trouble.

390
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,997
You saw all that in one night?

391
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,669
It is a strange world.

392
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,137
Why are there people like Frank?

393
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,057
Why is there so much trouble in this world?

394
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,602
I don't know.

395
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,984
I had a dream.

396
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,574
In fact, it was the night I met you.

397
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,418
In the dream, there was our world,

398
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,215
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

399
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,176
And the robins represented love.

400
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,892
And for the longest time
there was just this darkness.

401
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,895
And all of a sudden

402
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,232
thousands of robins were set free.

403
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,903
And they flew down and
brought this blinding light of love.

404
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,658
And it seemed like that love

405
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,829
would be the only thing
that would make any difference,

406
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,249
and it did.

407
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,677
So I guess it means...

408
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,973
...there is trouble
till the robins come.

409
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,602
You're a neat girl.

410
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,896
So are you.

411
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,316
I mean... you're a neat guy.

412
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,871
I guess we better go.

413
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,583
Yeah. I guess so.

414
00:58:09,402 --> 00:58:11,945
Hi. May I come in?

415
00:58:12,113 --> 00:58:13,739
Yes.

416
00:58:16,201 --> 00:58:17,576
Hurry, though.

417
00:58:26,127 --> 00:58:27,753
Are you all right?

418
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:30,214
No, I'm not.

419
00:58:32,217 --> 00:58:34,051
Why are you here?

420
00:58:34,219 --> 00:58:36,595
- What do you want?
- I, um...

421
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:41,266
I looked for you in my closet tonight.

422
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:48,440
It's crazy, I know.
I don't know where you come from, but...

423
00:58:49,609 --> 00:58:50,943
...I like you.

424
00:58:52,403 --> 00:58:56,281
It's not crazy. I like you too.

425
00:59:00,703 --> 00:59:02,955
I liked being with you last night.

426
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,541
Same here.

427
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:14,132
Please be with me.
Be with me, please.

428
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:17,649
Logs, logs, logs. Lumberton, USA.

429
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,818
At the sound of the falling tree...

430
01:02:21,487 --> 01:02:22,738
..it's 1:30.

431
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,823
This is the mighty voice of Lumberton,

432
01:02:24,991 --> 01:02:28,702
the town where people really know
how much wood a woodchuck chucks.

433
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,788
..seven, eight, nine,

434
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,750
10, 11, 12,

435
01:02:34,917 --> 01:02:36,835
13, 14, 15,

436
01:02:37,003 --> 01:02:40,964
16, 17, 18, 19, 20...

437
01:02:41,132 --> 01:02:43,341
- Keep going.
- Sandy.

438
01:02:43,509 --> 01:02:46,219
...23, 24, 25.

439
01:02:49,265 --> 01:02:51,057
Oh, great.

440
01:02:52,643 --> 01:02:54,352
- You're late.
- I'm sorry.

441
01:02:55,396 --> 01:02:58,607
- What am I gonna do now?
- You wanna go talk to him?

442
01:02:58,775 --> 01:03:02,527
Yeah, but...
I don't think it's gonna do much good.

443
01:03:02,695 --> 01:03:05,614
Let's just go.
I'll try to talk to him later.

444
01:03:15,041 --> 01:03:16,625
See that clock on the wall?

445
01:03:19,337 --> 01:03:20,504
Yeah.

446
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:24,633
Five minutes from now, you're not
gonna believe what I've told you.

447
01:03:29,764 --> 01:03:31,348
Number one.

448
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:35,644
Today I staked out Frank's place with a camera.

449
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:41,608
There's another man involved in all
this. I call him the Yellow Man.

450
01:03:43,027 --> 01:03:45,612
You saw his back the other day
at Dorothy's apartment.

451
01:03:45,780 --> 01:03:51,618
Today I saw the Yellow Man go into
Frank's building, laughing with Frank.

452
01:03:52,245 --> 01:03:54,454
Now, the only trouble is, what does that prove?

453
01:03:55,581 --> 01:03:59,334
Nothing, really. But it's interesting.

454
01:04:01,754 --> 01:04:03,213
Number two.

455
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:05,841
I saw the Yellow Man come out

456
01:04:06,008 --> 01:04:09,636
and meet a well-dressed man
carrying an alligator briefcase.

457
01:04:24,569 --> 01:04:28,446
They went to a factory, stood on a
staircase and looked into the distance.

458
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:37,414
Now get this. In the distance,
there was a murder.

459
01:04:38,457 --> 01:04:41,835
A drug dealer was shot to death
and a woman had her legs broken.

460
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:43,253
Jeffrey...

461
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:52,387
Then two guys told me the police would
find drugs in the dead dealer's place.

462
01:04:53,431 --> 01:04:55,473
I can't believe what you're finding out.

463
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,436
Are you gonna continue with this?

464
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:02,647
Yeah.

465
01:05:03,983 --> 01:05:06,610
Until when?
What are you gonna do with this?

466
01:05:06,777 --> 01:05:08,653
Well, I don't know.

467
01:05:11,073 --> 01:05:13,658
You're not going back to her apartment?

468
01:05:14,452 --> 01:05:15,577
Yeah.

469
01:05:17,830 --> 01:05:19,456
Jeffrey, why?

470
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:26,046
I'm seeing something that was always hidden.

471
01:05:27,840 --> 01:05:31,509
I'm involved in a mystery.
I'm in the middle of a mystery.

472
01:05:31,677 --> 01:05:34,095
And it's all secret.

473
01:05:34,263 --> 01:05:37,140
You like mysteries that much?

474
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,392
Yeah.

475
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:44,189
You're a mystery.

476
01:05:44,357 --> 01:05:47,651
I like you...

477
01:05:48,861 --> 01:05:50,487
...very much.

478
01:06:00,122 --> 01:06:01,539
Yeah?

479
01:06:10,299 --> 01:06:13,802
Jeffrey, don't. Please.

480
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:23,812
You worry about me? Really?

481
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,689
Yeah.

482
01:06:25,856 --> 01:06:28,400
Is that so surprising?

483
01:06:29,318 --> 01:06:31,903
Yeah, I worry... a lot.

484
01:06:34,323 --> 01:06:36,241
I got you into this.

485
01:07:45,978 --> 01:07:47,729
Come to my bedroom.

486
01:08:04,663 --> 01:08:06,831
What do you want to do?

487
01:08:06,999 --> 01:08:08,875
I'm doing it.

488
01:08:09,794 --> 01:08:11,669
Are you a bad boy?

489
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:14,297
What do you mean?

490
01:08:14,465 --> 01:08:17,092
Do you wanna do bad things?

491
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:19,177
Anything.

492
01:08:19,970 --> 01:08:21,262
Anything.

493
01:08:24,183 --> 01:08:25,767
What do you want?

494
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,478
I want you to hurt me.

495
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:32,565
No. I don't wanna hurt you.
I told you, I wanna help you.

496
01:08:32,733 --> 01:08:35,693
Dorothy, I know some of what’s happening.

497
01:08:35,861 --> 01:08:39,239
Frank has your husband and son, doesn't he?

498
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:43,076
Dorothy, you gotta do something,
go to the police or...

499
01:08:45,204 --> 01:08:46,454
No police!

500
01:08:47,540 --> 01:08:48,957
No police!

501
01:08:49,208 --> 01:08:50,166
Don!

502
01:08:50,334 --> 01:08:52,669
- Hit me!
- No! No!

503
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:55,964
Get away! Get away from my bed!
Stay away!

504
01:09:24,577 --> 01:09:26,411
I have your disease in me now.

505
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:53,563
It used to make me laugh.

506
01:09:55,608 --> 01:09:57,108
I'm sorry, Dorothy.

507
01:09:59,862 --> 01:10:02,405
- I should go.
- Yes.

508
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,080
You think I'm crazy, don't you?

509
01:10:12,416 --> 01:10:13,917
I want you to stay.

510
01:10:14,627 --> 01:10:17,629
- Don't hate me.
- I sure don't hate you.

511
01:10:18,923 --> 01:10:20,465
I'm not crazy.

512
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,760
I know the difference between right and wrong.

513
01:10:25,262 --> 01:10:26,721
That's good.

514
01:10:28,974 --> 01:10:30,808
You're my special friend.

515
01:10:34,647 --> 01:10:36,814
I still have you inside of me.

516
01:10:38,234 --> 01:10:39,567
It helps me.

517
01:10:41,153 --> 01:10:42,570
I need you.

518
01:10:44,657 --> 01:10:45,949
I'll call you.

519
01:10:46,116 --> 01:10:47,533
OK.

520
01:10:48,827 --> 01:10:50,578
- Soon?
- Mm.

521
01:10:53,540 --> 01:10:55,667
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

522
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,503
- Are you sure?
Hey!

523
01:11:01,674 --> 01:11:03,174
Hello, baby.

524
01:11:04,843 --> 01:11:09,806
- Who is this fuck?
- A friend. He's from the neighborhood.

525
01:11:11,308 --> 01:11:12,850
We were just talking.

526
01:11:13,352 --> 01:11:15,019
Ohh!

527
01:11:16,146 --> 01:11:17,855
You're from the neighborhood.

528
01:11:18,023 --> 01:11:19,816
Yeah.

529
01:11:20,359 --> 01:11:21,859
You're a neighbor.

530
01:11:23,904 --> 01:11:27,448
- Well, what's your name, neighbor?
- Jeffrey.

531
01:11:28,117 --> 01:11:29,701
He's a good kid, Frank.

532
01:11:31,203 --> 01:11:33,204
Shut the fuck up!

533
01:11:36,625 --> 01:11:38,376
Hey, you wanna go for a ride?

534
01:11:38,544 --> 01:11:40,586
No, thanks.

535
01:11:41,213 --> 01:11:43,423
"No, thanks"?
What does that mean?

536
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:46,634
- I don't wanna go.
- Go where?

537
01:11:46,802 --> 01:11:50,430
- For a ride.
- A ride. Hell, that's a good idea.

538
01:11:50,597 --> 01:11:52,974
OK. Let's go.

539
01:11:55,978 --> 01:11:59,188
Let's go. Get your fuckin' robe!

540
01:11:59,356 --> 01:12:00,356
Raymond?

541
01:12:00,899 --> 01:12:03,067
Come on. We're gonna go for a joyride.

542
01:12:03,235 --> 01:12:05,028
Joyride.

543
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,625
All right, where do you wanna go?

544
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,589
Oh, I know.
We got to go to Ben's, right?

545
01:12:24,757 --> 01:12:26,591
Oh, right.
We've got to see Ben.

546
01:12:27,634 --> 01:12:30,261
Yeah, we got to, got to, got to, got to.

547
01:12:30,429 --> 01:12:32,096
We may all be killed.

548
01:12:35,642 --> 01:12:39,854
- He's a pussy, Frank.
- Yeah, but he's our pussy.

549
01:12:40,022 --> 01:12:42,106
- Right, tits?
- Pussy heaven.

550
01:12:43,609 --> 01:12:45,443
You ever been to pussy heaven?

551
01:12:45,611 --> 01:12:46,527
No.

552
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:50,823
- What'd he say?
- No. No. Hasn't been to pussy heaven.

553
01:12:55,079 --> 01:12:57,205
- Po-lice call. Po-lice call.
- Bury that fuck!

554
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:03,628
This... is... it.

555
01:13:05,589 --> 01:13:06,589
Raymond?

556
01:13:08,592 --> 01:13:09,634
Thank you, Raymond.

a friend of mine.

560
01:13:27,778 --> 01:13:31,322
Hey, Raymond?

01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:33,658

01:14:21,665 --> 01:14:25,460
Darling, could you bring some glasses?
And we'll have a beer with Frank.

Where's the glasses?

01:17:00,198 --> 01:17:03,409
Thank you for the toast.
That was very nice, neighbor.

611
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,203
Did he hurt your little face?

612
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,627

Gordon went right up to 'em in broad
daylight, 'cause he's the man, right?

619
01:17:59,091 --> 01:18:02,301
He took those drugs away
and it was fuckin' beautiful.

620
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:06,597
A candy-colored clown
they call the Sandman.

621
01:18:10,769 --> 01:18:12,853
Let Tits see her kid, huh?

622

Where are we going, Frank?

641
01:21:33,179 --> 01:21:36,640
I'm takin' your neighbor
out to the fuckin' country.

642
01:21:39,102 --> 01:21:40,811
Hey, do you like to walk?

643
01:21:40,979 --> 01:21:43,981
- Hey, I'm talkin' to you, shithead.

644
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:46,817
He said "What?", Frank.

645
01:21:46,985 --> 01:21:49,570

646
01:21:55,035 --> 01:21:58,245
Hey! What has this fuck

You fuck!

649
01:22:11,676 --> 01:22:14,637
- What're you looking at?
- Nothing.

650
01:22:15,972 --> 01:22:17,681
Don't you look at me, fuck!

651
01:22:19,225 --> 01:22:21,977
I shoot when I see the whites of the eyes.

652
01:22:45,543 --> 01:22:47,211
You're like me.

653
01:22:53,510 --> 01:22:54,885
Oh, look at those. Ooh.

654
01:22:55,887 --> 01:22:58,097
Ooh, what are these? Mmm!

655
01:22:58,264 --> 01:23:01,725
- Please, Frank, let's go.
- Don't say please, fuckhead!

656
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:08,315
Ooh, baby...
Ooh, baby wants to pinch them.

657
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:10,609
Ooooh! Ooh...!

658
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:13,570
Ooh, what's the matter?
Ooh, ooh, give 'em back.

659
01:23:13,738 --> 01:23:16,490
Ooh. What's the matter?
They're just a little red, that's all.

660
01:23:16,658 --> 01:23:20,035
Oh! Let me feel 'em.
Oh! Come here. Mmm!

661
01:23:20,203 --> 01:23:21,245
Hey, leave her alone!

662
01:23:29,504 --> 01:23:30,504
Goddamn!

663
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,174
Next! You, out of the car, fuck!

664
01:23:36,011 --> 01:23:37,970
Get him out of the car, Raymond!

665
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,099
- Frank! Frank! He didn't mean anything!
- Shut up! Shut up.

666
01:23:58,575 --> 01:24:02,536
Pretty, pretty. Pretty, pretty.

667
01:24:05,248 --> 01:24:07,374
Frank, leave him alone!

668
01:24:07,542 --> 01:24:09,376
Frank! Frank!

669
01:24:14,049 --> 01:24:16,967
Paul... candy-colored clown.

670
01:24:19,971 --> 01:24:22,431
You're fuckin' lucky to be alive.

671
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,812
- Look at me.

672
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:38,739
Candy-colored clown.

673
01:24:48,666 --> 01:24:50,667
Don't be a good neighbor to her.

674
01:24:52,837 --> 01:24:54,713
I'll send you a love letter.

675
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,300
Straight from my heart, fucker!

676
01:24:59,719 --> 01:25:01,678
Do you know what a love letter is?

677
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:05,224
It's a bullet from a fuckin' gun, fucker.

678
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:10,562
You receive a love letter from me,
you are fucked forever!

679
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:13,774
You understand, fuck?

680
01:25:16,945 --> 01:25:18,987
I'll send you straight to hell, fucker!

681
01:25:22,325 --> 01:25:24,952
- In dreams...

682
01:25:26,704 --> 01:25:28,205
- ...I walk with you.

683
01:25:29,082 --> 01:25:34,878
- In dreams... I talk... to you.

684
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:40,884
- In dreams... you're mine.

685
01:25:41,052 --> 01:25:44,388
- All...

686
01:25:48,518 --> 01:25:53,397
- Forever in dreams.

687
01:26:04,826 --> 01:26:09,413
- Feel this.

688
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:24,261
Feel my muscles. Huh?

689
01:26:24,429 --> 01:26:28,098
Feel 'em! Huh? You like that?

690
01:26:30,143 --> 01:26:31,727
Hold him tight for me.

691
01:26:35,231 --> 01:26:36,440
Frank, stop it!

692
01:26:38,943 --> 01:26:42,029
Frank, stop it! Frank! Stop!

693
01:26:46,117 --> 01:26:49,620
Frank, stop it! Stop it!

694
01:26:51,873 --> 01:26:53,457
Stop it, Frank!

695
01:27:53,768 --> 01:27:55,018
Hit me.

696
01:28:19,711 --> 01:28:21,378
No, Donny, Mama loves you!

697
01:28:43,067 --> 01:28:45,986
What do you mean,
you're lucky to be able to call me?

698
01:28:46,154 --> 01:28:47,738
Things got out of hand.

699
01:28:49,657 --> 01:28:54,745
I know some things. They could help your
father, but you might get into trouble.

700
01:28:54,912 --> 01:28:58,206
Look, forget me. You've got to tell him.

701
01:28:58,374 --> 01:29:02,544
OK. I promise I won't mention you.

702
01:29:02,712 --> 01:29:06,840
Jeffrey, I mean it. It doesn't matter.

703
01:29:07,008 --> 01:29:09,843
Good. I'll see you Friday,
if not before.

704
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:11,178
OK.

705
01:29:11,346 --> 01:29:12,971
- Bye-bye, Sandy.
- Bye.

706
01:29:30,281 --> 01:29:31,865
- I don't wanna talk about it.
- But...

707
01:29:32,033 --> 01:29:36,536
Everything is OK now.
I just don't wanna talk about it.

708
01:29:36,704 --> 01:29:41,708
Sometimes it's good to talk things over.
For instance, they say many marriages...

709
01:29:41,876 --> 01:29:45,879
Aunt Barbara...
I love you but you're gonna get it.

710
01:30:17,662 --> 01:30:19,329
Gordon.

711
01:30:19,497 --> 01:30:23,583
Gordon went right up to 'em in broad
daylight, 'cause he's the man, right?

712
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:27,879
He took those drugs away and it was beautiful.

713
01:31:01,456 --> 01:31:02,581
I got it.

714
01:31:05,710 --> 01:31:08,295
- Jeffrey. Come on in.
- Jeffrey.

715
01:31:10,840 --> 01:31:13,467
- Hi, Sandy.
- Hi, Jeffrey.

716
01:31:13,634 --> 01:31:15,427
Sorry to bother you, but I need to talk.

717
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:18,513
OK. Looks like you had a bad face-lift.

718
01:31:18,681 --> 01:31:21,308
- Yeah.
- Come on into my study.

719
01:31:26,898 --> 01:31:30,025
I have to show you some photos
and tell you some things about them.

720
01:31:34,572 --> 01:31:36,031
This is the first picture.

721
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,367
It's Frank Booth.

722
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:44,080
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

723
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:47,250
His address is on the back of the photo.

724
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,923
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

725
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:16,613
And then that man came out and met
with a third man. This well-dressed guy.

726
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,198
Here's that photo.

727
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:26,498
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

728
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:32,003
I think Frank kidnapped her husband
and son. I have no hard proof of this.

729
01:32:35,341 --> 01:32:38,426
- Is Sandy part of this?
- Oh, no. No.

730
01:32:41,889 --> 01:32:43,932
Who else knows you have these photos?

731
01:32:44,100 --> 01:32:46,518
Just you and the photo lab.

732
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:51,022
- And you're through with this now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

733
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:59,656
For now, all right, you better be. And
Sandy better not be involved with this.

734
01:33:05,162 --> 01:33:07,706
Be prepared to come in
for further interrogation on this later.

735
01:33:09,500 --> 01:33:10,834
Yes, sir.

736
01:33:20,177 --> 01:33:24,681
- Is everything OK?
- Yeah. Is Friday still on?

737
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:28,560
- You didn't tell him about me?
No. Shh.

738
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:31,855
- Why did I ever get you going on this?

739
01:33:35,526 --> 01:33:39,571
- Of course Friday's still on.
- Great. See ya then.

740
01:33:40,698 --> 01:33:42,282
Good night, Detective Williams.

741
01:33:47,538 --> 01:33:49,789
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Jeffrey.

742
01:33:59,550 --> 01:34:00,717
Dad?

743
01:34:02,178 --> 01:34:03,386
What's wrong?

744
01:34:04,722 --> 01:34:06,389
There better be nothin' wrong.

745
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:05,323
- Let's see.

746
01:35:06,784 --> 01:35:09,119
- I'll get it.
- OK, thanks.

747
01:35:13,457 --> 01:35:15,709
- Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks, Mrs. Williams.

748
01:35:15,876 --> 01:35:17,585
- She's all ready.
- OK.

749
01:35:19,797 --> 01:35:22,465
- You look great.
- Thanks.

750
01:35:23,592 --> 01:35:25,593
- Hello, Detective Williams.
- Hello, Jeffrey.

751
01:35:25,761 --> 01:35:27,804
- You all set?
- Almost.

752
01:35:27,972 --> 01:35:29,889
Hey, John, get a move on.

753
01:35:36,981 --> 01:35:37,981
Just a minute, Tom.

754
01:35:40,401 --> 01:35:42,485
Easy does it, Jeffrey.

755
01:35:44,071 --> 01:35:47,449
Behave yourself. Don't blow it.

756
01:35:49,201 --> 01:35:51,035
Come on, John. Get it in gear, pal.

757
01:35:51,996 --> 01:35:55,457
So long, Jeffrey.
You two have a nice time tonight, OK?

758
01:35:55,624 --> 01:35:57,333
- OK.
- What's goin' on?

759
01:35:57,501 --> 01:36:00,253
Just a little fatherly advice.

760
01:36:00,421 --> 01:36:02,213
That's right, Jeffrey.

761
01:36:02,381 --> 01:36:04,007
Come on.

762
01:36:04,842 --> 01:36:06,509
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

763
01:36:07,011 --> 01:36:10,054
- Good night, Mom.
- Bye. Have a good time.

764
01:36:10,222 --> 01:36:11,806
- Night, Sandy.
- Good night, Tom.

765
01:36:19,857 --> 01:36:22,859
- Jeffrey, what was that all about?
- It's nothing.

766
01:36:24,028 --> 01:36:25,278
Really.

767
01:36:26,864 --> 01:36:28,364
It's good to see you.

768
01:36:28,532 --> 01:36:30,909
It's good to see you.

769
01:36:38,042 --> 01:36:39,751
You look beautiful.

770
01:36:42,880 --> 01:36:43,755
Thank you.

771
01:36:48,761 --> 01:36:50,845
Hi.

772
01:36:52,139 --> 01:36:53,723
Hi.

773
01:37:18,374 --> 01:37:20,750
- It's all taken care of.
- OK.

774
01:37:22,169 --> 01:37:23,795
You want something to drink?

775
01:37:26,048 --> 01:37:27,423
Wanna dance?

776
01:37:29,426 --> 01:37:30,718
Yeah.

777
01:38:35,326 --> 01:38:36,993
I love you, Jeffrey.

778
01:38:41,498 --> 01:38:43,166
I love you, too.

779
01:39:22,873 --> 01:39:25,083
Bye. See you later.

780
01:40:09,420 --> 01:40:11,963
- What's goin' on?
- What is it?

781
01:40:13,841 --> 01:40:15,091
They're gonna hit us.

782
01:40:16,385 --> 01:40:19,303
- Oh, my God, what's wrong?
- It's Frank.

783
01:40:26,854 --> 01:40:28,271
- Move it!

784
01:40:28,439 --> 01:40:29,605
Hang on.

785
01:40:33,527 --> 01:40:36,612
I can't outrun this guy.
My father's got a gun at home.

786
01:40:36,780 --> 01:40:38,031
Jeffrey, no.

787
01:40:38,198 --> 01:40:39,949
Sandy, this guy's a killer.
I promise you.

788
01:40:44,788 --> 01:40:47,874
It's Mike! Jeffrey, it's Mike.
Oh, my God.

789
01:40:56,884 --> 01:41:00,011
Get outta the car!
Come on! Get outta there!

790
01:41:01,263 --> 01:41:04,474
You stole my girl, you bastard.
I'm gonna kick your ass.

791
01:41:04,641 --> 01:41:08,061
Right here, in front of your own
stupid house. Get outta here!

792
01:41:08,228 --> 01:41:09,604
Mike, stop it.

793
01:41:09,772 --> 01:41:13,316
Shut up! Just shut up, all right?
Nobody's talkin' to you.

794
01:41:13,484 --> 01:41:16,819
Come on, Mike. Look, I don't
wanna cause any problems.

795
01:41:18,697 --> 01:41:21,324
- Who's that? Is that your mother?
- Dorothy.

796
01:41:21,492 --> 01:41:24,911
- No, come here, you Ivy League shit.
- She's hurt, in case you didn't notice.

797
01:41:25,746 --> 01:41:26,829
Dorothy Vallens?

798
01:41:35,881 --> 01:41:37,298
Come on.

799
01:41:46,433 --> 01:41:49,602
I'm really... Hey, I'm sorry.

800
01:41:51,980 --> 01:41:54,315
I'm really sorry.
I didn't know. I'm really sorry.

801
01:41:54,483 --> 01:41:56,317
It's OK. It's OK.

802
01:41:56,485 --> 01:41:58,486
I thought you were gonna kill him, man.

803
01:41:58,654 --> 01:42:00,321
We've gotta get her outta here.

804
01:42:00,489 --> 01:42:03,574
Go to my house.
My father can get an ambulance fast.

805
01:42:03,742 --> 01:42:07,328
- His partner won't be there, will he?
- Probably not. Why?

806
01:42:07,496 --> 01:42:10,414
- Nothing.
- Watch out for Mike.

807
01:42:12,042 --> 01:42:13,376
Oh, God.

808
01:42:14,503 --> 01:42:16,337
Is that you, Jeffrey?

809
01:42:17,047 --> 01:42:18,381
Yeah. It's me.

810
01:42:18,549 --> 01:42:20,216
Oh, Jeffrey...

811
01:42:21,385 --> 01:42:22,718
Jeffrey...

812
01:42:29,810 --> 01:42:32,562
Dad? Mom?

813
01:42:32,729 --> 01:42:35,273
I'm in here, honey.
- Mom!

814
01:42:35,440 --> 01:42:37,358
All right, I'll be right there.

815
01:42:37,860 --> 01:42:42,071
- Is Dad home?
- No. He oughta...

816
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:45,324
You better call him.
And, uh... get an ambulance.

817
01:42:45,492 --> 01:42:46,826
Where have you been?

818
01:42:46,994 --> 01:42:49,036
Oh, God.

819
01:42:49,872 --> 01:42:55,126
Oh, God, they've hurt him.
Oh, Jeffrey! Jeffrey, Jeffrey, hold me!

820
01:42:55,294 --> 01:42:57,712
- Hold me! Hold me!
- It's OK, it's OK.

821
01:43:03,677 --> 01:43:05,386
My secret lover.

822
01:43:07,848 --> 01:43:10,558
I've called for an ambulance.
The police are on their way.

823
01:43:10,726 --> 01:43:12,560
Don't get the police!

824
01:43:14,104 --> 01:43:15,521
Stop it!

825
01:43:16,398 --> 01:43:18,441
I love you! Love me!

826
01:43:21,987 --> 01:43:23,988
He put his disease in me.

827
01:43:25,115 --> 01:43:28,409
Tell me it's all right I opened myself to you.

828
01:43:29,244 --> 01:43:32,955
- Tell me it's all right.
- Sandy, please...

829
01:43:33,123 --> 01:43:36,292
- Sandy?
- I'll get a coat to put on her.

830
01:43:40,464 --> 01:43:43,466
Jeffrey? What's going on here?

831
01:43:43,634 --> 01:43:45,301
Shh. I'll tell you.

832
01:43:46,178 --> 01:43:49,722
They... they've hurt his head.

833
01:43:49,890 --> 01:43:52,099
Who, Dorothy?

834
01:43:53,227 --> 01:43:56,646
Don. Help him.

835
01:43:58,315 --> 01:43:59,649
Help him.

836
01:44:01,235 --> 01:44:03,653
Promise me you'll help him!

837
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:16,082
He put his disease in me.

838
01:44:35,352 --> 01:44:37,853
Would you like to come in the ambulance?

839
01:44:38,021 --> 01:44:39,522
I'll be right with you.

840
01:44:48,198 --> 01:44:49,657
I should go.

841
01:44:49,825 --> 01:44:51,701
- Go.
- Sandy...

842
01:45:00,585 --> 01:45:03,045
Hold me! I'm falling!

843
01:45:03,213 --> 01:45:05,881
I'm falling! Hold me!

844
01:45:12,681 --> 01:45:18,144
- You lied to me.
Sandy, please, forgive me.

845
01:45:18,312 --> 01:45:20,229
I love you.

846
01:45:21,148 --> 01:45:23,232
I forgive you, Jeffrey.

847
01:45:28,864 --> 01:45:30,906
I love you.

848
01:45:35,037 --> 01:45:37,246
I love you.

849
01:45:39,207 --> 01:45:43,294
I... But I couldn't watch that.

850
01:45:49,092 --> 01:45:51,802
- Is she OK?
- Yeah, she's OK.

851
01:45:51,970 --> 01:45:55,765
Get your father. Tell him to send
the police to Dorothy's apartment.

852
01:45:55,932 --> 01:45:58,601
Tell him to hurry.
I'm leaving right now.

853
01:45:58,769 --> 01:46:01,937
- Jeffrey, no.
- I have to.

854
01:46:02,105 --> 01:46:04,815
- I love you.
- Oh, God, be careful.

855
01:46:04,983 --> 01:46:06,609
I will, believe me.

856
01:46:18,413 --> 01:46:19,789
Where...

857
01:46:23,251 --> 01:46:25,252
Where is my dream?

858
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:41,143
Look, this is an emergency.

859
01:46:41,311 --> 01:46:45,314
He said someone was hurt
and he wants Detective Williams there.

860
01:46:45,482 --> 01:46:48,401
We do not know his whereabouts at this time.

861
01:46:48,568 --> 01:46:49,777
Well, find him!

862
01:48:48,230 --> 01:48:50,606
Get back and stay down.

863
01:48:53,318 --> 01:48:55,736
He's going to apartment 26.

864
01:48:57,364 --> 01:49:02,409
Lieutenant, we're at Frank's place now.
The raid has commenced, as scheduled.

865
01:49:06,456 --> 01:49:08,123
Stay in place.

866
01:49:13,213 --> 01:49:15,798
Number 25 is vacant,
so maybe we can go through there.

867
01:49:40,865 --> 01:49:42,950
I'm gonna let them find you on their own.

868
01:51:45,699 --> 01:51:47,282
Detective Williams.

869
01:51:47,450 --> 01:51:51,203
- Detective Williams?
- Williams here. Is that you, Jeffrey?

870
01:51:51,371 --> 01:51:54,665
Yeah, it's me. I'm hiding
in Dorothy Vallens' apartment.

871
01:51:54,833 --> 01:51:57,000
Frank is on his way
in a well-dressed-man disguise.

872
01:51:57,168 --> 01:51:58,961
I've got no way out...

873
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:01,797
He's got a radio.

874
01:52:03,758 --> 01:52:04,758
Jeffrey!

875
01:52:08,972 --> 01:52:12,808
Detective Williams?
I'm hiding in the back bedroom.

876
01:52:12,976 --> 01:52:14,727
Please hurry.

877
01:52:27,907 --> 01:52:29,491
Hey, neighbor.

878
01:52:30,410 --> 01:52:34,496
You shit-for-brains, man!
You forgot I have a police radio!

879
01:52:37,876 --> 01:52:39,585
One well-dressed fuckin' man

880
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:43,088
knows where your fuckin'
cute little butt's hidin'.

881
01:52:45,467 --> 01:52:47,342
Stupid fuck.

882
01:52:49,179 --> 01:52:50,888
Fuck with me, man.

883
01:53:02,066 --> 01:53:06,487
Here I come, ready or not.

884
01:53:06,863 --> 01:53:10,866
Lockdown in progress.
Cars 21 through 25...

885
01:53:12,285 --> 01:53:13,952
You fuck!

886
01:53:14,746 --> 01:53:18,081
I can hear your fuckin' radio, you stupid shit!

887
01:53:19,417 --> 01:53:22,127
You got about one fuckin'
second to live, buddy!

888
01:53:24,214 --> 01:53:27,257
You're one sorry piece of shit, mister.

889
01:53:35,016 --> 01:53:38,936
- Hey, pretty, pretty!

890
01:53:39,103 --> 01:53:41,647
- Whoo-oo!

891
01:53:46,402 --> 01:53:50,405
What the fuck... Where are you?
Where are you?

892
01:54:58,474 --> 01:55:00,309
Oh, Jeffrey.

893
01:55:08,818 --> 01:55:10,277
It's all over, Jeffrey.

894
01:56:46,624 --> 01:56:50,210
Jeffrey, lunch is ready.
- OK.

895
01:57:01,848 --> 01:57:04,224
- How you guys doin'?
- Hey, Jeffrey.

896
01:57:04,392 --> 01:57:07,978
Hey, Jeff.
Feelin' much better now, Jeff.

897
01:57:08,146 --> 01:57:09,521
Good deal, Dad.

898
01:57:11,441 --> 01:57:13,900
Sandy, look.

899
01:57:19,240 --> 01:57:20,407
Lunchtime.

900
01:57:20,575 --> 01:57:22,617
- OK, Jeffrey.
- Sounds good.

901
01:57:22,785 --> 01:57:25,203
Jeffrey, come over here
and look at this.

902
01:57:27,582 --> 01:57:28,957
Look.

903
01:57:30,126 --> 01:57:32,627
Yeah, I saw him outside.

904
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:35,172
Maybe the robins are here.

905
01:57:37,133 --> 01:57:41,428
I don't see how they could do that.
I could never eat a bug.

906
01:57:44,515 --> 01:57:46,308
It's a strange world.

907
01:57:47,435 --> 01:57:48,810
Isn't it?
