00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,147
DOCTOR: Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,617
WENDY:
When was the Overlook built?

5
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,511
BOTH:
Yes.

6
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,340
WENDY: Oh, no!
DANNY: Keep America clean.

00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,436

Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

01:16:43,114 --> 01:16:49,077
NOBODY: This is a poorly made subtitle.
Subtitles should not have more than 2 lines,
but fixing this automatically is very hard.

12
01:16:49,177 --> 01:16:53,014
NOBODY: Let's see if this awful regex
also works with 2 people in the same subtitle.
SOMEBODY: Yeah, let's!

01:16:53,177 --> 01:16:55,014
This tool has
one purpose, and one purpose only:

14
01:16:55,114 --> 01:16:57,114
To obliterate crappy SRT files.
