1
00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,401
TEST FILE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY.
NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED.
Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

2
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:15,700
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

3
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:18,789
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

4
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,918
Press pass this!

5
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,299
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,848
What do you say, Billy? VVon't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

7
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,780
Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
Yeah, man, speed up.

8
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:01,037
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

9
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,666
- Holy shit!

10
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,961
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

11
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,506
You fucking assholes!

12
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:09,594
Vlfe are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

13
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,182
Yeehavv!

14
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:14,062
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

15
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:18,529
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

16
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,867
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

17
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:23,914
Chi, chi, chi!
- I'm in a oar full of morons.

18
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:27,171
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

19
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,385
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

20
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:33,016
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

21
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,435
Oh, jeez. VVhoa, Jesus.

22
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,709
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

23
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,172
Hey, guys! Guys!

24
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:52,511
VVe forgot the beer!

25
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,264
No!

26
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:34,801
Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

27
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,694
Can I help you?

28
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,409
Uh, yeah. VVhere's your beer at?

29
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,290
Beer's in the back.

30
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,555
You see the way them kids looked?

31
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:06,237
Read that list back to me.
OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

32
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,535
hacksaw, baling hooks,

33
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:13,084
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

34
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,921
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

35
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,509
"crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

36
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,847
- _.lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

37
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,349
_.hand drill...

38
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:30,200
_.feminine napkins,
stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

39
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,830
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

40
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:37,298
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

41
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:47,902
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

42
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,703
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

43
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,879
There's nothing so special about them.

44
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:02,262
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

45
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:03,890
You know something, Dale?

46
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:06,395
She's just human.
Why don't you go over and talk to her?

47
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,819
Talk to her? VVhat?
What in the world would I say?

48
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,120
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation
home. That'll probably impress her.

49
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,835
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

50
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:21,299
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

51
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,513
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

52
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,477
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

53
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,939
more or less.

54
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,316
You got a damn good heart.

55
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:31,945
Yup.

56
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:35,493
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

57
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,538
VVhat's the worst that could happen?

58
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:41,589
You know something?

59
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,639
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

60
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:49,060
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

61
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:53,570
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

62
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:55,156
It shows confidence.

63
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,412
Smile and laugh. OK.

64
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,458
- Do it.
- All right.

65
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:19,160
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

66
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,510
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

67
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,347
- Sojust...back off.
- VVhoa!

68
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,850
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

69
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:34,774
Get in the truck.

70
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:40,451
That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...

71
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:53,476
I told you, Tucker. I'm a zero with the ladies.

72
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,734
They hate my face!

73
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,653
Come on.

74
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:09,550
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the Iadyfolk the way you can.

75
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,096
No one can. I mean, I...

76
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,270
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

77
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:20,028
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

78
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,615
No, I don't.

79
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,326
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

80
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:26,666
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

81
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,043
Mm-hm.

82
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:31,467
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

83
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,136
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

84
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,642
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. VVe got a cop.

85
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,228
- Oh, I got you.

86
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,485
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

87
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,488
All right, he's pulling over.

88
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:44,701
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

89
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:47,414
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

90
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,792
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

91
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,423
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

92
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:53,259
He's out of his car?
He's coming.

93
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,054
- Tucker!
- Get it...

94
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,274
Yeah.

95
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,783
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

96
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,415
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
Yeah.

97
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:10,500
Licence, please.

98
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:15,385
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

99
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,517
Temporary.

100
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,188
Where you two headed?

101
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,487
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

102
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,535
I sank every penny I had into it.

103
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:32,084
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix 'er up,
maybe do a little fishin'.

104
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,048
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

105
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,971
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

106
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,900
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

107
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:51,621
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

108
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:53,333
Oh, yes, sir.

109
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,171
See that you, uh...

110
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,762
get that fixed.

111
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,766
That was very helpful.

112
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,535
- Man, that was tense.
That dude's weird.

113
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:12,829
There he goes.

114
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,000
Bye _

115
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,757
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

116
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,764
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

117
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,060
Ah.VVe||...

118
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:27,566
Here's to the good life, huh?

119
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,949
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

120
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:51,069
I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

121
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,909
I know, I know.
Is that ours?

122
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,913
Wow. And another one right there.

123
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh, my God.

124
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:18,414
It's perfect!

125
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,295
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

126
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:25,178
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

127
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:28,434
- I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!

128
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,705
- \N'ell, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

129
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:54,734
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

130
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,531
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

131
00:09:57,572 --> 00:10:00,746
Look at this.
Nlust have been a real news junkie, too.

132
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:12,811
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

133
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:16,109
- All right.
- Score!

134
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:20,117
Tucker, look! They got my favourite
board game here, too.

135
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,875
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

136
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,465
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

137
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,718
You know something?

138
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,142
Dreams really do come true.

139
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:34,436
- Look out!

140
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,861
- VVhoa!
VVe||, I guess we should fix that.

141
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:41,157
Yeah, that's a good idea.

142
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,706
You can get off me now.

143
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:48,296
If you have a reoccurring dream about
sucking a dick but never do it, are you gay?

144
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:49,882
Yes.
- Really?

145
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,092
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

146
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,599
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

147
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,894
No!
Chuck, no.

148
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,773
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

149
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,862
You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

150
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:05,079
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

151
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,469
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

152
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,937
It was 20 years ago today.

153
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,702
The Memorial Day Massacre.

154
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:31,170
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

155
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,925
they came out here to have a good time...

156
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:41,691
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

157
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:00,060
Get another one! Come on!

158
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:09,955
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

159
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,251
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

160
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,542
Only one person lived to tell this story.

161
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,090
The rest of them just disappeared...

162
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:03,307
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

163
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:09,068
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

164
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,197
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

165
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:13,743
- I do.
- Yeah.

166
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:17,125
- All right.
I'm not getting naked.

167
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:28,272
Uh... That's OK, Tuck.

168
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:30,109
You take that. That's yours.

169
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,782
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

170
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:36,538
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

171
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,381
Do not even think about it.

172
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:43,885
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

173
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,098
- OW!
Are you serious?

174
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,104
VVhat'd I just say?

175
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:52,819
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

176
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,489
That was the last thing I said.

177
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:02,797
Hello?

178
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,304
Is someone there?

179
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,307
Guys?

180
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,486
Yargh!

181
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,408
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

182
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,455
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

183
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:21,959
No, it wasn't.

184
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,506
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

185
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,468
You totally freaked me out.

186
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,433
You know, you can drop the act now.

187
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:34,483
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

188
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:37,864
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

189
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,079
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

190
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:44,878
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

191
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,176
You and I, Allie...

192
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:51,891
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

193
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,023
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

194
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:00,867
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

195
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,711
Chad, you're drunk.

196
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:09,175
That's a good thing. It lowers my inhibitions.

197
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,264
OK, uh...

198
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,602
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

199
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,354
Why? Why stop?

200
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,070
We're perfect for each other.

201
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:24,830
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

202
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,917
Come on, Allie. Come on...

203
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:32,261
Oh, it's so cold!
Here we go!

204
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,102
VVhat's that all about?

205
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,945
I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

206
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,157
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

207
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,079
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

208
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:49,838
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

209
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,509
What the hell are you doing?

210
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,683
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

211
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,272
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

212
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,151
- OK.
- Hush.

213
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:05,659
Whoo-hoo! I love camping!

214
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,207
Look.

215
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,593
Oh.

216
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,147
- Tucker!
- Shush!

217
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,411
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

218
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,081
|\/Ie? VVhat did I do?

219
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,379
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

220
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:37,846
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

221
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:40,559
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

222
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:44,652
She didn't come up yet.

223
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,242
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

224
00:16:49,994 --> 00:16:53,417
Hey! Lady?

225
00:16:54,628 --> 00:16:56,258
Hey, lady!

226
00:16:56,299 --> 00:17:00,181
- VVhere'd she go, Tuck?
- VVhoa, whoa, Dale!

227
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:06,945
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

228
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,240
Get her legs!

229
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,829
Oh! No!

230
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,834
- Hey, we got your friend!
Oh, God!

231
00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:18,466
- They got Allison! Come on!

232
00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:21,598
Hey!

233
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:25,521
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

234
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:29,404
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

235
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:32,035
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

236
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,499
- Shit.

237
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,254
Chad! Chad!

238
00:17:38,296 --> 00:17:40,468
The hillbillies...

239
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,722
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

240
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,683
They captured Allison!

241
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:55,872
Allie!

242
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,524
Oh, God! No.

243
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:35,824
No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

244
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,243
Please don't cut me open!

245
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,797
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

246
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,886
- Doesn't like pancakes.

247
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:49,267
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

248
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:52,815
Pa... Pancakes?

249
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,074
Allison!

250
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,286
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

251
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:03,001
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

252
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,047
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

253
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:08,513
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one ofthe guys was...

254
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:10,474
|ike...eating her face off.

255
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,522
That is so disgusting.

256
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,693
Not to sound too cliché,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

257
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,362
And just leave Allison with them?

258
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,367
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

259
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,748
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

260
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:26,880
Vvhat if I go? It's my dad's truck. He told me
I was the only one allowed to drive it.

261
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,801
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

262
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:31,765
OK, awesome. I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

263
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:35,230
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

264
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:46,377
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

265
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,306
What is this place?

266
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:55,812
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

267
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:58,942
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

268
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,946
All right. Maybe I will.

269
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,790
I said maybe.

270
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:31,881
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

271
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:36,558
VVha-VVhat am I doing here?

272
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,856
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

273
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,527
VVe||, me and Tucker...

274
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,865
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

275
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:46,618
VVe||...

276
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:52,463
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

277
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,385
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

278
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,349
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

279
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,854
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

280
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:03,358
I dove in and rescued you.

281
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:08,953
- VVait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

282
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:11,208
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

283
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,962
VVe were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... VVe didn't see...

284
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,927
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

285
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,471
Where are my friends?

286
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:22,605
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

287
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,942
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

288
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,156
Some people just aren't any good in a crisis,

289
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:31,080
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

290
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,918
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

291
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,927
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

292
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,848
|t's OK, I...

293
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:43,311
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

294
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:45,732
- Me neither.
Yeah.

295
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:52,413
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

296
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:54,583
You can just pet him round the nose.

297
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:56,753
- He's drooling.
- I know.

298
00:21:57,714 --> 00:22:01,804
Anymfay, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

299
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,936
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

300
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:09,528
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

301
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:14,246
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

302
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,959
But, uh...anyv\/ay...

303
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,884
you should relax and rest, OK?

304
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:23,430
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

305
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,142
Uh...

306
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:28,065
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

307
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:31,529
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

308
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,741
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

309
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,792
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
A||ie...son.

310
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:41,005
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

311
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:43,009
I'll be right in the little room here.

312
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:47,352
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

313
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:50,566
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

314
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,194
Do you like board games?

315
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,243
What kind do you have?

316
00:22:57,453 --> 00:23:00,752
We got this one right here.
|t's my favourite. Trivi-Up.

317
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,636
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

318
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,473
No way, dude. You lost.

319
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:11,315
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

320
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,594
Goddamn Romeo.

321
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,684
Oh, well.

322
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,302
Oh, Jesus.

323
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,087
Aargh! Aargh! Argh!

324
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:08,383
Run! Run for your lives!

325
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,762
Yargh!

326
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,000
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

327
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,630
One, two, three, four, five.

328
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,384
OK, shoot.

329
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:17,182
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

330
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,060
Oh, that's too easy. That's James |\/Ionroe.

331
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:23,737
God, you are right again. You are killing me.

332
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:25,991
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

333
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,997
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

334
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,713
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

335
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:37,138
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

336
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,266
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

337
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:43,067
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

338
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:48,451
Yeah?

339
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,213
So, um, what is it that you study in college?

340
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:56,467
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

341
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:58,888
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

342
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:03,480
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

343
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,567
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

344
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,990
I-I have these stupid dreams.

345
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:10,619
Dreams are not stupid.

346
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:18,300
\N'ell, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

347
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,638
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

348
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,765
- Yeah.
- And I just...

349
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:25,188
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

350
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,734
No, don't! Don't!

351
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:30,825
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

352
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:35,166
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

353
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:38,048
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

354
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:39,592
Hey, hey.

355
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:42,221
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

356
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:44,559
I sawed into a bees' nest.

357
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:46,938
Why?

358
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,695
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

359
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,742
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

360
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:56,958
Yeah.

361
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:00,674
VVe came out here to work...

362
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:03,137
not sit around playing stupid board games!

363
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,101
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

364
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:08,689
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

365
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:12,406
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

366
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,325
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

367
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,706
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

368
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:20,629
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

369
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:23,552
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

370
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:24,762
Hi.

371
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:26,516
I saw your friend out there.

372
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:33,487
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

373
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:37,370
- I should go out there and find them...
No, no! That's... No!

374
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:41,085
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

375
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:44,384
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

376
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:47,806
We'|| go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

377
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,351
Ain't that right, Tucker?

378
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:52,565
Yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:55,697
Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

380
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,039
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

381
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,335
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

382
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:04,839
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anymfay.

383
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:07,970
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

384
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:14,024
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

385
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:24,962
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

386
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:30,222
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
I can't believe this is happening.

387
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:34,647
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

388
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:38,320
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

389
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:42,036
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

390
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:45,418
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

391
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,381
Survival of the fittest!

392
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:52,682
- What are you doing, man?

393
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,059
That's my whole face.

394
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:56,522
You have serious issues, you know that?

395
00:28:56,564 --> 00:29:00,321
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

396
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,954
And the answer was,
"isosceles triangle". You know what that is?

397
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:05,999
Is it a triangle?
Yeah.

398
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,170
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

399
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:11,719
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

400
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,473
Dale.
- Yeah?

401
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:16,311
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

402
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,980
I know. You keep telling me that.

403
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:22,490
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish
her off real quick then we'll get back to work.

404
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:24,619
They're gonna kill her!

405
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:29,878
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

406
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,801
College kids!

407
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:38,771
College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

408
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:42,361
College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

409
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:45,660
- College kids!

410
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,246
I don't see 'em.

411
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:50,209
They must have run off.

412
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:55,721
Well, hmm... Maybe vve could leave
them a note in case they come back.

413
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,015
All right. With what?

414
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,106
- \N'ell, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

415
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:05,781
- My face is as hot as a haemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

416
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:07,952
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

417
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,921
J` Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot

418
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,217
J` You think that girl is hot...

419
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,639
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

420
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,897
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

421
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:45,650
VVhoa.

422
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:48,071
- VVhat?
- Huh? VVhat?

423
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,743
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

424
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:52,956
They should be by here any minute.

425
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,967
- What are you doing?
- Oh, |'m digging a shitter hole.

426
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,138
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

427
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:03,893
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

428
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:06,607
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

429
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,989
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

430
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:13,622
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

431
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,374
Oh.

432
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,547
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

433
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:19,966
That's a good rule.

434
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,554
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

435
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:23,641
Yeah.

436
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,114
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

437
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,705
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

438
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:37,249
Yeah, yeah.

439
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,049
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

440
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,116
That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

441
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,827
VVe don't have much time.

442
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,418
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

443
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,466
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

444
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,646
I'm gonna just chill right here.

445
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,741
OK, one more load and we're done.

446
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:20,167
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

447
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:24,174
Now!

448
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:26,386
Huh?

449
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,352
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

450
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:32,940
Dale!

451
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:41,708
Oh, God!

452
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,284
Are you OK?

453
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:27,796
Allison, say something!

454
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,180
Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

455
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:34,392
You'|| never beli... What happened to you?

456
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,900
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

457
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:43,452
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

458
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:45,956
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

459
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:49,464
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

460
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:51,217
What the hell happened to her?

461
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:54,348
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

462
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:56,226
Is that your blood?
What? No.

463
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,608
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

464
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,029
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

465
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,991
- Holy crap.
- I know!

466
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,285
Calm down. Don't cry.

467
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:06,371
- Calm down!
- OK.

468
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,793
- Get a hold of yourself!

469
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:14,595
All right...
I know what this is.

470
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,642
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

471
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,730
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

472
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:23,612
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

473
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,285
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all ofthe sharp objects!

474
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:29,331
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

475
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,336
Yeah. Think about it.

476
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,302
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

477
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:39,935
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

478
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,276
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

479
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,196
Yeah, that's a good point.

480
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:47,784
OK, so what... what do we...

481
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:50,206
VVe go to the police?

482
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,001
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

483
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:55,841
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

484
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:58,137
That's a good idea, Dale.

485
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:02,437
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
VVe've had a doozy of a day.

486
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,819
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

487
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:08,199
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

488
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,993
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

489
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:13,208
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

490
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,467
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

491
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:21,641
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

492
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:23,478
So what the hell do we do?

493
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:26,776
VVe gotta clean this mess up.

494
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:30,074
- Right now.
- OK.

495
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:36,086
- You shou|dn't be smoking anyway, Chloe.

496
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:37,171
It's not good for you.

497
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:39,217
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

498
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:42,139
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

499
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,812
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are vve still doing here?

500
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,650
How are we gonna get outta here?

501
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,155
Dickvvad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

502
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:51,657
\N'ell, then let's walk.

503
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,912
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

504
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:56,834
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- VVIII y'all just shut up?

505
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:59,214
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

506
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,011
We never shou|d've come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

507
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,096
Chad!

508
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:10,152
You guys are all a bunch of fucking pussies,
you know that?

509
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:14,117
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

510
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,372
and everyone just freaks out.

511
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:19,837
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

512
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:23,886
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

513
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:27,936
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

514
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,279
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

515
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,828
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

516
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:40,376
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

517
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:44,760
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

518
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:48,017
maybe you deserve to die.

519
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,152
That's fucked up.

520
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:58,036
- Shh. Y'all hear that?

521
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,791
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

522
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,421
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

523
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,718
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

524
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,769
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

525
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,898
Fuck.

526
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,498
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

527
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,044
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

528
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:25,799
- Oh, God! Look out!

529
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,052
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

530
00:37:28,094 --> 00:37:29,347
They're dead!

531
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,808
They died!

532
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,644
Slow down, now.

533
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:34,940
- They killed them!
- OK.

534
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:40,868
Stay calm. \N'ell, why don't you kids climb in
the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

535
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,671
Those stupid fucks.

536
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,106
I don't think
I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

537
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:59,405
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

538
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,414
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

539
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:08,212
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

540
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:09,423
- OK.
- All right?

541
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:13,557
- One. Two. Three!

542
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,976
Argh!

543
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,983
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

544
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:22,240
Get it off me. Not on the face!

545
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,120
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

546
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:28,377
- You're OK, you're OK.

547
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:31,216
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

548
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,469
Get him over to the truck.

549
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,228
Oh, God. Oh, God.

550
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:39,482
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

551
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:47,957
Oh, shit.

552
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,096
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

553
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:58,853
You kids stay put.

554
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,860
I'll handle this.

555
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,827
Hey.
Hello, Officer.

556
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:08,872
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

557
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:14,591
- VVe have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

558
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:18,140
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

559
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:20,436
- _.minding our own business...
- Yup.

560
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:23,484
- _.making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

561
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:25,737
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

562
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:30,581
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

563
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:34,128
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

564
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:35,465
the woody right back there.

565
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:40,600
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

566
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:41,852
Straight through.

567
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:44,774
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

568
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,280
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

569
00:39:56,421 --> 00:40:01,265
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

570
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:02,935
- No...
-Oh, no.

571
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:06,316
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

572
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:10,741
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

573
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,167
- What?
- You say you were just working,

574
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:21,386
when this...kid...ran up
and stuffed his head into that wood chipper?

575
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:23,475
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

576
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:29,360
And I think maybe they might be
trying to kill the girl that we have inside.

577
00:40:29,402 --> 00:40:30,863
- What girl?
- You know what?

578
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:34,329
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

579
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,293
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

580
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,797
That's...
- On accident.

581
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:40,925
On accident.

582
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:45,266
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

583
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:48,397
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
That's...

584
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:54,535
You better show me what you done with her.

585
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:57,749
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

586
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,379
Great idea.
Why don't you go and show him?

587
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:02,925
VVait, where is he going?

588
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,683
- No, don't go in there.
Right this way, Sheriff.

589
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:12,819
VVhat's he doing?

590
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,408
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

591
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,594
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

592
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:30,437
- At least she's not braindead.
- Oh, thank God.

593
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:34,862
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

594
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:38,285
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

595
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,415
but you'd be lucky to get that.

596
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,672
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

597
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,725
VVe||, it's...
it's hard to say.

598
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:52,480
Looks can be deceiving.

599
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:53,899
Oh, don't!

600
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:59,493
Sheriff! You OK?

601
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:03,542
- Oh, shit!

602
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:06,256
Come on!
What is going on?

603
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:09,595
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

604
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:11,182
He's gonna be fine.

605
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,863
Don't worry, I got it.

606
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:23,415
- It's Sher... Sher...

607
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,130
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

608
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:29,134
- Unlock the door!

609
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:34,060
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

610
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:37,942
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

611
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:41,490
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

612
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:51,176
Unlock the fucking door!

613
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:55,058
If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

614
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:58,065
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

615
00:42:58,148 --> 00:42:59,233
Heads up.

616
00:42:59,317 --> 00:43:01,446
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

617
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:06,038
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

618
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,879
Don't do...

619
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,384
- Jesus! Oh, God!

620
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:16,474
You've got to start being more careful!

621
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,200
I don't think he understands!

622
00:43:26,244 --> 00:43:27,788
om

623
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,793
"You gotta take the safety off"?

624
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:35,386
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

625
00:43:35,428 --> 00:43:36,848
- What?
- That's right!

626
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:40,313
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

627
00:43:40,397 --> 00:43:45,072
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- VVell, at least she's still alive.

628
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:48,202
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-Iujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

629
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:51,585
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

630
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,171
VVe||, you know what, Tucker?

631
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:57,262
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

632
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:00,059
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

633
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,604
You don't like...

634
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:07,281
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

635
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:09,494
I like... I like it OK.

636
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:11,831
You know... I'm sorry.

637
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:15,714
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

638
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:19,471
- Yeah, you kinda did.

639
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:21,935
- Cut it out!

640
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:26,736
Tucker...

641
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:29,449
where's Jangers?

642
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:34,459
- Shit.
- Stay here.

643
00:44:35,503 --> 00:44:36,630
Aah! Damn.

644
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,593
Nuts...

645
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,810
- Hey, hillbilly! Your move.

646
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:45,480
Oh, son of a bitch!

647
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:47,985
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

648
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:50,239
VVe gotta do something.

649
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:53,871
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

650
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:57,629
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

651
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:05,685
Oh.

652
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:07,523
All right.

653
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,696
- Cover me.
- Uh...

654
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,866
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

655
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:17,834
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

656
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:19,588
- VVhoa!

657
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:23,888
\.Nhoa!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

658
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,016
Now, you create a distraction.

659
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,398
I'm gonna go out the back door.

660
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,778
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

661
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,988
Try not to shoot me.

662
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:35,994
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

663
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:39,835
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

664
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,970
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

665
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:09,809
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

666
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,609
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks!

667
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,746
- Shit!

668
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:31,685
Jesus, Dale.
Take it easy.

669
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:32,813
Hey, hillbilly!

670
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:37,572
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

671
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:42,373
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

672
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:43,708
Then bring out the girl!

673
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:50,639
I'm gonna shoot your dog!

674
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,225
I'm gonna get really mad!

675
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,811
I'll get really mad!

676
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,030
Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

677
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,625
Oh!

678
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:08,006
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

679
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,587
Oh, God. Please, no.

680
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,564
Are we done yet?

681
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:25,030
I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

682
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:27,618
All right...trap's set.

683
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,168
- Hey...he's awake.

684
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:38,180
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

685
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:40,809
What is the matter with us?

686
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,020
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

687
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:44,066
VVait. Stop...

688
00:48:47,323 --> 00:48:49,661
I've never stood so close to pure evil before.

689
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:59,554
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

690
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:01,182
OK! Don't...

691
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:05,983
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

692
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:08,823
It's payback time, hillbilly.

693
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:14,332
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

694
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:16,253
I can get my cooler.

695
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:19,885
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

696
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:23,559
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

697
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:26,815
This is for |\/like!
- No!

698
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:33,369
OW! You prick.

699
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:42,054
- Dale?
- Allison.

700
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,725
How are you feelin'?

701
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:49,150
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

702
00:49:51,153 --> 00:49:52,364
VVha...

703
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,870
What happ...

704
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:56,706
- What happened?
- Oh...

705
00:49:58,627 --> 00:49:59,796
VVe||, uh...

706
00:50:01,256 --> 00:50:03,511
I can't...
I can't really say.

707
00:50:03,552 --> 00:50:04,639
Um...

708
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:08,312
It was so awful.

709
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:12,779
Oh, my God.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

710
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,576
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

711
00:50:15,618 --> 00:50:17,914
It's good to cry sometimes.

712
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:20,001
It's OK, just...

713
00:50:20,043 --> 00:50:21,754
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

714
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:27,725
There you go. It'll feel better.

715
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:33,193
Come on, just take a deep breath.

716
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:40,291
There we go. Now...

717
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:43,087
Now tell me what happened.

718
00:50:44,715 --> 00:50:47,764
VVe||...it's hard to say.

719
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:49,016
Um...

720
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:52,314
Your friends...

721
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,154
Do some of your friends take medication?

722
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:59,745
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

723
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:04,670
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

724
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:08,720
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

725
00:51:08,762 --> 00:51:11,309
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

726
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:13,897
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

727
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:17,195
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

728
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:21,578
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

729
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,212
and then Todd was running at us, and...

730
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:30,303
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

731
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:32,642
At first I thought they were trying to kill you,

732
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:37,901
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

733
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:40,156
and now they're going after my dog...

734
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,700
..Jangers.

735
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:43,913
I guess they just like killing.

736
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:47,378
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

737
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:49,174
- Jesus, they're here!

738
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:52,429
They're not gonna stop till they kill all of us,
I'm telling you. Hide!

739
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:55,060
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

740
00:51:55,102 --> 00:51:57,607
Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

741
00:51:57,648 --> 00:52:00,069
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

742
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:03,241
- What? No, no.
- |t's all just a big misunderstanding.

743
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:05,205
VVe'|| clear it right up, OK?

744
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:08,294
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

745
00:52:12,844 --> 00:52:13,887
Oh, my God.

746
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,655
- Ugh!
Allison!

747
00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:32,131
Oh!

748
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,031
Did you see them?

749
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:49,456
- No.
- No?

750
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:55,426
That's from Tucker's shirt.

751
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:59,602
What is that?

752
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,062
Oh, my God!

753
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:03,859
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

754
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:07,950
There's a note right there.

755
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:24,023
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

756
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:29,200
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

757
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,329
A few hours.

758
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:33,083
I don't understand what...

759
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:34,627
I gotta go help Tucker.

760
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,089
God damn it.

761
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:39,762
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

762
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:43,979
- Wait. We don't vvant to escalate things.
- We don't vvant to escalate things?

763
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,692
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

764
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:48,737
Oh, and why would they think that?

765
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:53,121
I... I don't know.

766
00:53:53,914 --> 00:53:55,293
I think you do know.

767
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:59,884
VVe||, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

768
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:04,434
we just thought that you looked...

769
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,397
a little creepy.

770
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:09,612
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

771
00:54:09,653 --> 00:54:11,615
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

772
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:13,869
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

773
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:16,709
VVe misjudged you, Dale. I...

774
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,341
I'm really sorry.

775
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,177
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

776
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,061
I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

777
00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:28,732
somebody'd end up dead.

778
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:32,030
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

779
00:54:32,072 --> 00:54:34,576
If you do see your friends...

780
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:37,456
tell 'em that I never wanted to hurt anybody.

781
00:54:38,626 --> 00:54:41,172
Dale, Dale, stop. VVait. No...

782
00:54:41,214 --> 00:54:42,424
Don't go there.

783
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:47,977
Oh, shit.

784
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,438
Tucker!

785
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:54,155
- Tucker, you cut there?

786
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:02,505
Tuck!

787
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:25,884
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

788
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:31,978
Tucker!

789
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,651
Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

790
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:37,531
Tucker?!

791
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,534
Yeah.

792
00:55:39,576 --> 00:55:41,205
Tuck! Tucker!

793
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:44,545
Dale...
- Hey!

794
00:55:45,546 --> 00:55:47,008
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

795
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:49,596
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

796
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,015
What?

797
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,478
Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

798
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,980
I don't wanna die! Please!

799
00:55:55,858 --> 00:55:58,906
Oh, God! Tucker!

800
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:00,367
Dale...

801
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:06,379
Oh. Oh... Oh...

802
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:08,591
I never thought I'd say this,

803
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:10,428
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

804
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:13,642
That's funny.

805
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:15,563
VVhoa...

806
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:18,987
-Oh...
- Dale...

807
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:22,618
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

808
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:24,998
I know. Let's get you down from there.

809
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,126
- Wait!

810
00:56:27,168 --> 00:56:28,547
Sorry about that.

811
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,300
This vacation sucks.

812
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:33,514
Come on, let's go.

813
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:54,471
Look at this place.

814
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:59,940
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

815
00:57:02,404 --> 00:57:03,656
Allison!

816
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:05,242
- Allison!
- Chad?

817
00:57:06,495 --> 00:57:08,123
- Chad?
- Shh!

818
00:57:08,164 --> 00:57:09,375
What are you guys doing?

819
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,295
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

820
00:57:11,337 --> 00:57:14,552
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

821
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,098
oh.

822
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,316
This place is really freaky.

823
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:25,030
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

824
00:57:25,072 --> 00:57:27,243
They haven't done anything to me.

825
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:29,539
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

826
00:57:29,581 --> 00:57:33,629
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

827
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,093
What? No, no. Chad...

828
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,181
Chad! Stop.

829
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:41,020
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

830
00:57:42,564 --> 00:57:46,155
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

831
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:48,074
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

832
00:57:48,117 --> 00:57:52,708
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

833
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,754
You have no idea...

834
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:58,136
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

835
00:57:58,178 --> 00:57:59,973
- Huh?
- No.

836
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:04,481
These freaks are evil...

837
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,323
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

838
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:10,535
OK, just relax, all right?

839
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:14,041
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

840
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:17,047
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

841
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:20,346
- while you guys have been terrorising them.
- But they started this!

842
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:23,476
By doing what? Saving my life?

843
00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:28,402
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

844
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,115
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

845
00:58:30,157 --> 00:58:33,078
When someone vvho's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

846
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,461
You're falling in love with him?

847
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:39,841
No. VV-VVhat?

848
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:43,724
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

849
00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:48,524
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

850
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,781
How could you love him?

851
00:58:53,451 --> 00:58:55,788
Chad, please. You don't understand.

852
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,669
VVe||, are you or are you not
in love with him?

853
00:58:58,711 --> 00:59:00,506
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

854
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:05,057
Hey! Let the girl go.

855
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:06,560
Tcha!

856
00:59:07,896 --> 00:59:11,736
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

857
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:15,953
VVait. Everyone just stop for a second
and |et's talk this out, OK?

858
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:18,374
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

859
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:20,586
You could have fooled me.

860
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:23,174
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

861
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:26,181
VVait! Hovv about I make some tea,

862
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:29,103
and we all sit and talk this out?

863
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:33,695
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

864
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:36,451
I'm gonna go get a beer.

865
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:40,208
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

866
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,462
In this chair.

867
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:44,132
Dale, you...

868
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:46,888
you sit in this one.

869
00:59:54,402 --> 00:59:56,908
OK, good. Now, um...

870
00:59:57,784 --> 00:59:59,329
I'm gonna get the tea.

871
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:06,091
Is that camomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

872
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:07,761
it's Earl Grey.

873
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:09,933
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

874
01:00:12,437 --> 01:00:17,029
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

875
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:23,583
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

876
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:24,710
OK?

877
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,384
OK.

878
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:30,931
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

879
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:34,897
and understand each other's perspective
before any progress can be made.

880
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:38,946
OK.

881
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:40,867
Chad, why don't you start?

882
01:00:42,453 --> 01:00:46,294
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

883
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:49,091
A long time ago,

884
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:52,390
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

885
01:00:52,432 --> 01:00:54,143
This is important.

886
01:00:57,106 --> 01:01:00,989
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

887
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:05,707
It was 20 years ago.

888
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,543
The Memorial Day Massacre.

889
01:01:09,547 --> 01:01:13,012
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

890
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:16,645
- My mother ran for her life.

891
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:18,147
But they captured hen

892
01:01:27,082 --> 01:01:29,126
My father was helpless...

893
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:32,842
and he didn’t even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

894
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,142
And they forced him to watch...

895
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,440
while they tortured hen

896
01:01:43,905 --> 01:01:46,576
But my mom, she fought back...

897
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:49,667
- ..and she escaped.

898
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:53,173
But my father wasn’t so lucky.

899
01:01:58,058 --> 01:02:00,396
His body was never found.

900
01:02:07,743 --> 01:02:09,956
By the time I was born...

901
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:12,794
my mother was already institutionalised.

902
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:17,094
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

903
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,321
OK. Um...

904
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:30,662
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

905
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,821
No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

906
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:51,494
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

907
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:53,331
we come in, guns blazing.

908
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:58,215
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

909
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:13,619
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

910
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:16,083
No!

911
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,419
No way.

912
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:19,631
They're fucking trapped.

913
01:03:19,673 --> 01:03:22,094
Oh...yeah.

914
01:03:22,136 --> 01:03:25,142
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

915
01:03:28,608 --> 01:03:29,693
It's your turn.

916
01:03:30,904 --> 01:03:33,325
OK, well...

917
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,954
First of all...

918
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:41,591
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

919
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:43,929
That is awful.

920
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:48,438
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

921
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,445
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

922
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,785
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

923
01:03:55,827 --> 01:04:00,419
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

924
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,800
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

925
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:05,720
I just can't do it!

926
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:09,938
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

927
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,359
how do you feel?

928
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:15,197
I feel better. I feel...

929
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:17,410
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

930
01:04:18,412 --> 01:04:21,961
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

931
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:26,010
It's show time, freaks!

932
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,891
Jason! No!

933
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:32,355
Jesus Christ!

934
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,743
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

935
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:41,456
Chad, st...

936
01:04:42,124 --> 01:04:43,461
- Get him, Tucker!

937
01:04:45,422 --> 01:04:46,466
Dale!

938
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,183
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

939
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,688
- Oh, shit!
VVhoa!

940
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,984
- Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

941
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,613
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

942
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:59,449
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

943
01:05:01,078 --> 01:05:02,163
Aargh!

944
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,294
Aargh!

945
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:06,630
Stop, drop, and roll!

946
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:10,053
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

947
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:18,528
He's crackling like a log!

948
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:19,864
Oh, that stinks.

949
01:05:22,703 --> 01:05:24,915
- Oh, shit!
I knew I shoulda moved that.

950
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,469
Allie, run!
Run!

951
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,555
Come on, let's go!

952
01:05:33,765 --> 01:05:35,769
- Help me!

953
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:37,858
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

954
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:49,672
My cabin.

955
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:52,177
Your cabin.

956
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,765
I'm a terrible therapist.

957
01:05:54,848 --> 01:05:57,937
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

958
01:05:57,979 --> 01:06:00,360
I thought you did a great job in there.

959
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,529
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

960
01:06:03,782 --> 01:06:06,579
I think we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

961
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,709
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

962
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:11,923
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

963
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,142
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

964
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:19,980
VVait. Maybe we should help him.

965
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,324
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

966
01:06:25,366 --> 01:06:27,244
Get to the truck!

967
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:29,581
Tucker! Tucker!

968
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:33,047
He's coming!

969
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:37,639
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

970
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:40,269
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

971
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:42,273
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

972
01:06:42,315 --> 01:06:44,445
This is the only thing I got left.

973
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:47,241
Go.

974
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:55,716
Oh!
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

975
01:06:55,758 --> 01:06:57,302
Dale, look out!
- Huh?

976
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:14,710
Jangers, not now, boy.

977
01:07:14,794 --> 01:07:17,759
Jangers, hey!

978
01:07:19,595 --> 01:07:21,349
VVhoa. Jangers!

979
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:24,062
Allie.

980
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:26,483
Allison!

981
01:07:27,736 --> 01:07:29,657
Jangers... Allison!

982
01:07:30,616 --> 01:07:31,868
She's gone.

983
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:34,582
What the hell... Tucker?

984
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:41,137
Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

985
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:44,309
- He took her.

986
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,230
I tried to stop him.

987
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:49,779
- VVhoa, take it easy.

988
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:51,115
I tell you something, Dale.

989
01:07:51,198 --> 01:07:53,745
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

990
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:57,710
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

991
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:00,550
- Look at you.
- Nah.

992
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:04,349
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

993
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,519
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

994
01:08:06,561 --> 01:08:08,731
- That's not true.
- It is true!

995
01:08:08,774 --> 01:08:11,529
I never should have even
came out here with you.

996
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:13,742
Listen to me.

997
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:18,709
Do you remember when we was kids...

998
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:22,175
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

999
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:24,220
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

1000
01:08:25,473 --> 01:08:29,647
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

1001
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:33,028
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

1002
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:37,830
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

1003
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:40,793
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

1004
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:42,964
That always made me feel kinda funny.

1005
01:08:43,005 --> 01:08:45,344
Yeah. VVe||, the thing is...

1006
01:08:46,763 --> 01:08:48,684
I didn't let you catch more.

1007
01:08:49,644 --> 01:08:52,065
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

1008
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:54,153
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

1009
01:08:54,194 --> 01:08:59,538
What |'m trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

1010
01:09:00,665 --> 01:09:03,044
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

1011
01:09:04,088 --> 01:09:07,763
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

1012
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,979
You know, I think that she...

1013
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:14,984
really sees you for who you are.

1014
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:18,867
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

1015
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:21,372
you two can...

1016
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:24,586
_.date or something.

1017
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:28,720
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1018
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:30,556
I don't want any more negativity.

1019
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,437
- OK.
- Stop it!

1020
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,858
- OK.
- You are a good man.

1021
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,154
You're smart...

1022
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,701
and you're strong...

1023
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:44,083
and you're not as ugly as you think you are.

1024
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:48,298
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1025
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,055
Life is short.
- I know.

1026
01:09:52,766 --> 01:09:56,231
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

1027
01:09:56,314 --> 01:09:59,069
She needs you now more than ever,

1028
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:03,537
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

1029
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:07,502
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'|| know.

1030
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,016
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

1031
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:16,729
I'll be fine. Go.

1032
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,204
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

1033
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:28,835
- Oh, Jesus!

1034
01:10:28,919 --> 01:10:30,547
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1035
01:10:30,589 --> 01:10:32,217
OK.

1036
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:36,434
That hurt very much!

1037
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:38,772
I could tell. Just breathe in.

1038
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:40,274
Out through your mouth.

1039
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:42,237
Go get her. Go get her.

1040
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,744
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

1041
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:48,874
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

1042
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:52,506
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

1043
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,051
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

1044
01:11:15,049 --> 01:11:17,220
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

1045
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:20,936
OK.
You gotta let me take it from here, OK, pup?

1046
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:24,109
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

1047
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,155
More or less. OK, stay.

1048
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:32,792
What is the matter with you?

1049
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:35,255
What is the matter with me?

1050
01:11:35,297 --> 01:11:39,764
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

1051
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:40,850
No.

1052
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,813
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

1053
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:47,153
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

1054
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,241
but you're gonna have to beg.

1055
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:51,329
Chad...

1056
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:55,836
Oh!

1057
01:11:56,838 --> 01:11:59,594
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

1058
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:02,308
You see, we're making up, Allie,

1059
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,396
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

1060
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:06,023
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

1061
01:12:06,065 --> 01:12:07,651
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

1062
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,029
Just stop, please!

1063
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:11,575
No. I'm not gonna stop.

1064
01:12:11,617 --> 01:12:13,663
I've only just begun.

1065
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:41,175
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

1066
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:05,221
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

1067
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:06,682
It's OK.
- Dale?

1068
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:08,436
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

1069
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:11,817
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

1070
01:13:12,652 --> 01:13:14,698
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

1071
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,165
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

1072
01:13:19,249 --> 01:13:20,960
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

1073
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:23,423
Hang on.

1074
01:13:25,927 --> 01:13:29,225
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

1075
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:32,524
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anymfay, so...

1076
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,917
How sweet.

1077
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:46,801
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

1078
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:48,179
What kind of knot is this?

1079
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,975
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

1080
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:54,691
It’s time to say goodbye to the girl.

1081
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:56,904
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

1082
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:03,626
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

1083
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,295
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

1084
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:10,555
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

1085
01:14:10,597 --> 01:14:13,560
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

1086
01:14:13,602 --> 01:14:15,649
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

1087
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:27,380
Oh, that is really too bad.

1088
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,972
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

1089
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:38,192
- Dale!

1090
01:14:57,688 --> 01:15:00,026
- Dale!

1091
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:06,830
Dale!

1092
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:21,067
It's time for you to feel my pain.

1093
01:15:22,277 --> 01:15:23,738
Bring it, frat bitch.

1094
01:15:46,825 --> 01:15:50,874
Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

1095
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:56,135
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

1096
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,432
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1097
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,566
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

1098
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:06,279
Put a couple boxes on there.

1099
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:09,911
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

1100
01:16:09,952 --> 01:16:11,998
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1101
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,589
- OK. OK.
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

1102
01:16:15,631 --> 01:16:18,594
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

1103
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:22,059
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

1104
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,521
Nah! Shit...

1105
01:16:23,562 --> 01:16:26,819
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

1106
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,904
Or not.

1107
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,589
Oh, my God. Dale?

1108
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:39,802
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

1109
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,060
Look.

1110
01:16:44,102 --> 01:16:46,189
- VVhat?
- Something look familiar?

1111
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:49,989
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

1112
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:53,328
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

1113
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:56,542
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

1114
01:16:56,584 --> 01:16:58,379
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1115
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:03,139
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

1116
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,896
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

1117
01:17:06,937 --> 01:17:09,651
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

1118
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,870
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

1119
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,082
His father's body was never found.

1120
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,590
I think we've just found him.

1121
01:17:20,673 --> 01:17:22,801
Holy S-H-I-T.

1122
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,889
Jesus Christ!

1123
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,517
Chad!

1124
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:30,816
- Time to die, freak!
Wait!

1125
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:32,195
Just wait! VVait, wait!

1126
01:17:32,237 --> 01:17:33,949
VVait, Chad! VVait!

1127
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:36,328
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

1128
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,997
- No! Look!

1129
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:40,085
That's your real father.
Right there!

1130
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:43,007
No. No!

1131
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:45,095
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

1132
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,395
It can't be.

1133
01:17:52,525 --> 01:17:54,572
They lied to me!

1134
01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:58,120
How could they?

1135
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:00,082
Maybe they didn't vvant you
to know the truth.

1136
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:01,960
There is no truth!

1137
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:05,259
Everything is a lie!

1138
01:18:09,057 --> 01:18:11,478
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

1139
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,816
- What?
- It's the ingredient in camomile tea

1140
01:18:13,858 --> 01:18:18,326
that causes an anaphylactic reaction
in rare cases where people are allergic to it.

1141
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,288
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

1142
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,335
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

1143
01:18:30,641 --> 01:18:32,227
Or not.

1144
01:18:42,163 --> 01:18:44,793
OK, here we go.
And, you ready?

1145
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:48,091
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

1146
01:18:48,132 --> 01:18:50,680
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

1147
01:18:54,186 --> 01:18:58,403
The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

1148
01:18:58,444 --> 01:19:00,156
is still being unravelled.

1149
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:02,912
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

1150
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:06,419
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

1151
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,595
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

1152
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:15,477
- The killings happened on the ....
Knock knock. Hey!

1153
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:20,403
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

1154
01:19:21,113 --> 01:19:22,867
high on prescription medication.

1155
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,121
- Yeah, looks like it.

1156
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:27,667
They found my fingers.

1157
01:19:28,627 --> 01:19:30,047
Check it out.

1158
01:19:30,088 --> 01:19:32,134
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

1159
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:35,683
I don't remember that one looking that way.

1160
01:19:35,725 --> 01:19:37,937
Does that look funny to you?

1161
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:39,357
No. No, not really.

1162
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,324
That looks natural. It's good.

1163
01:19:43,366 --> 01:19:45,285
By the way, I brought you something.

1164
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,414
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

1165
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:49,042
OK, open them.

1166
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:51,714
Oh...

1167
01:19:51,756 --> 01:19:53,968
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

1168
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,100
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

1169
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,812
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

1170
01:19:58,853 --> 01:20:00,231
Look what else I got you.

1171
01:20:00,314 --> 01:20:03,069
A bendy straw,
your favourite sipping utensil.

1172
01:20:03,152 --> 01:20:05,156
- - There you go.

1173
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:07,537
Mmm. |\/Im!

1174
01:20:07,578 --> 01:20:10,751
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

1175
01:20:10,793 --> 01:20:13,673
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, |'m gonna have more.

1176
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,050
- Dale?
- Yeah?

1177
01:20:15,802 --> 01:20:17,264
Did you ask her?

1178
01:20:18,725 --> 01:20:22,733
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

1179
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:25,529
Oh.VVe||...

1180
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:30,622
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

1181
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:31,708
Dale!

1182
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:34,881
You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

1183
01:20:34,922 --> 01:20:39,140
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

1184
01:20:40,099 --> 01:20:41,351
Except for...

1185
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:45,735
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

1186
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:46,820
we're goin' bowling.

1187
01:20:49,284 --> 01:20:51,914
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

1188
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:55,755
OW.

1189
01:20:56,756 --> 01:20:58,718
VVhoo! Yes.

1190
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,228
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck.

1191
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:06,692
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

1192
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:10,032
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

1193
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,913
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

1194
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:15,793
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

1195
01:21:15,835 --> 01:21:18,382
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

1196
01:21:18,465 --> 01:21:21,303
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

1197
01:21:21,387 --> 01:21:23,934
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

1198
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:25,228
Yeah.

1199
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:27,190
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

1200
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,903
Hey.

1201
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:32,659
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

1202
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:37,168
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

1203
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:39,297
but I got you a little something.

1204
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:42,845
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1205
01:21:42,887 --> 01:21:44,182
I know. I wanted to.

1206
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,062
Oh, my gosh.

1207
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:50,986
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

1208
01:21:51,028 --> 01:21:52,614
It's a pink helmet.

1209
01:21:52,655 --> 01:21:56,330
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

1210
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:58,375
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1211
01:21:58,417 --> 01:21:59,878
|t's perfect.

1212
01:22:01,548 --> 01:22:03,301
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

1213
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:06,475
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

1214
01:22:06,517 --> 01:22:09,104
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

1215
01:22:09,146 --> 01:22:13,196
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

1216
01:22:13,238 --> 01:22:16,284
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

1217
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:19,416
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

1218
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:22,171
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

1219
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:26,805
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

1220
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:28,476
and I want to let you know that I...

1221
01:22:30,437 --> 01:22:32,066
I feel the same way.

1222
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:36,365
- Really?
- Really.

1223
01:22:38,494 --> 01:22:40,123
- BJ!

1224
01:22:41,793 --> 01:22:44,464
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

1225
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:45,592
Hell, no.

1226
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:51,979
Whatever.
