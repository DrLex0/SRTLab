00:00:10,105 --> 00:00:12,401
TEST FILE FOR DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES ONLY.
NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED.
(Man) Should we be doing this?
It's still a crime scene.

2
00:00:12,443 --> 00:00:15,700
Sack up, Billy. It's called
"investigative journalism" for a reason.

3
00:00:15,742 --> 00:00:18,789
Yeah, but don't we need a press pass
or a permit or something?

4
00:00:18,831 --> 00:00:20,918
Press pass this!

5
00:00:20,959 --> 00:00:24,299
You know, the police missed
something here, I can feel it.

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,848
What do you say, Billy? VVon't a Peabody
Award look great up on your...

00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:30,186
- (Reporter whimpers)
- (Cameraman gasps)

8
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:31,898
(Cameraman screaming)

9
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:34,277
(Thud)

10
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:57,780
(Boy 1) Yo, Chuck, speed up, man!
(Boy 2) Yeah, man, speed up.

11
00:00:57,822 --> 00:01:01,037
Guys, this is my dad's car.
So if I go any faster, he will kill me.

12
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,666
- Holy shit!
- (Car horn)

13
00:01:03,417 --> 00:01:04,961
- Shit!
- Jesus, that was close.

14
00:01:05,004 --> 00:01:06,506
You fucking assholes!

15
00:01:06,548 --> 00:01:09,594
Vlfe are in hillbilly country now, boys.
Squeal like a pig!

16
00:01:09,636 --> 00:01:11,182
(Boy) Yeehavv!

17
00:01:11,224 --> 00:01:14,062
Chad, just cos they're not in your
fraternity doesn't mean they're freaks.

18
00:01:14,146 --> 00:01:18,529
Actually, it does, Allison. You see,
you're either Omega Beta or you're a freak.

19
00:01:18,612 --> 00:01:20,867
- Omega Beta! Omega Beta!
- Fuck.

20
00:01:20,908 --> 00:01:23,914
- (In unison) Chi, chi, chi!
- I'm in a oar full of morons.

21
00:01:23,956 --> 00:01:27,171
No, if we were morons,
we wouldn't have thought to bring this.

22
00:01:27,797 --> 00:01:30,385
OK, I stand corrected.
You are a fucking genius.

23
00:01:30,427 --> 00:01:33,016
Hey, Chuck, speed up, man.
They're gonna pass us.

24
00:01:33,058 --> 00:01:34,435
Oh, jeez. VVhoa, Jesus.

25
00:01:43,995 --> 00:01:46,709
Did you see the way
those guys looked at us?

26
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:49,172
Hey, guys! Guys!

27
00:01:50,925 --> 00:01:52,511
VVe forgot the beer!

28
00:01:52,552 --> 00:01:54,264
(All shout) No!

29
00:02:29,291 --> 00:02:34,801
(Hillbilly accent) Sure you got everything
you need? Cos once you get up there...

30
00:02:41,982 --> 00:02:43,694
Can I help you?

31
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,409
Uh, yeah. VVhere's your beer at?

32
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:50,290
Beer's in the back.

33
00:02:52,378 --> 00:02:53,838
(Sniffs)

34
00:02:56,844 --> 00:02:58,555
You see the way them kids looked?

35
00:03:02,188 --> 00:03:06,237
(Customer) Read that list back to me.
(Shopkeeper) OK, three-quarter-inch nails,

36
00:03:06,279 --> 00:03:09,535
hacksaw, baling hooks,

37
00:03:09,576 --> 00:03:13,084
brush-clearing Scythe, clamps...

38
00:03:13,126 --> 00:03:14,921
Hey, Chad, do we need more bug...

39
00:03:15,004 --> 00:03:17,509
- (Shopkeeper) "crosscutting handsaw...
- Chad?

40
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:19,847
- _.lubricated condoms...
- Chad?

41
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:21,349
_.hand drill...

42
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:23,646
(Gasps)

43
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:30,200
(Shopkeeper) _.feminine napkins,
stone bit, one-eighth hole saw...

44
00:03:31,118 --> 00:03:32,830
- Oh, my God!
- It's just me.

45
00:03:32,872 --> 00:03:37,298
Let's get out of here.
This place is so creepy.

46
00:03:44,268 --> 00:03:47,902
- Dale, we need anything else?
- Pickled eggs. Six-pounder.

47
00:03:50,197 --> 00:03:53,703
Oh, hot dog, Tucker. Have you ever
seen anything like that in your life?

48
00:03:54,955 --> 00:03:57,879
There's nothing so special about them.

49
00:03:57,921 --> 00:04:02,262
- They're just your average college girls.
- Nothing average about that.

50
00:04:02,304 --> 00:04:03,890
You know something, Dale?

51
00:04:03,932 --> 00:04:06,395
She's just human.
Why don't you go over and talk to her?

52
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:09,819
Talk to her? VVhat?
What in the world would I say?

53
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:15,120
I don't know. Tell her that you got a vacation
home. That'll probably impress her.

54
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:17,835
Are you out of your mind, Tucker?
These are college girls.

55
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:21,299
They grew up with vacation homes,
and guys like me fixing their toilets.

56
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,513
You gotta have some faith in yourself, man.
Girls can smell fear.

57
00:04:24,555 --> 00:04:27,477
Now come on!
You are a good-lookin' man...

58
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,939
more or less.

59
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:30,316
You got a damn good heart.

60
00:04:30,358 --> 00:04:31,945
Yup.

61
00:04:31,987 --> 00:04:35,493
I mean, that's two things right there.
Now, go on, get over there.

62
00:04:35,577 --> 00:04:37,538
VVhat's the worst that could happen?

63
00:04:40,545 --> 00:04:41,589
You know something?

64
00:04:43,175 --> 00:04:46,639
- You're right, Tuck. I'm gonna do it.
- All right.

65
00:04:46,681 --> 00:04:49,060
- I'm gonna do it right now.
- All right, hold up.

66
00:04:49,102 --> 00:04:53,570
All right, now, whatever you say,
just smile and laugh.

67
00:04:53,612 --> 00:04:55,156
It shows confidence.

68
00:04:55,198 --> 00:04:58,412
Smile and laugh. OK.

69
00:04:59,372 --> 00:05:00,458
- Do it.
- All right.

70
00:05:10,185 --> 00:05:11,562
(Clanging)

71
00:05:16,155 --> 00:05:19,160
You guys, uh...goin' campin'?

72
00:05:19,202 --> 00:05:20,664
(Laughs manically)

73
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:27,510
Hey! Hey. Now, look...
we don't want any trouble, all right?

74
00:05:27,552 --> 00:05:29,347
- Sojust...back off.
- VVhoa!

75
00:05:29,389 --> 00:05:30,850
- OK. OK. I'm sorry.
- Back off!

76
00:05:33,646 --> 00:05:34,774
Get in the truck.

77
00:05:37,697 --> 00:05:40,451
- (Dale) That's a-a good-lookin' cooler...
- (Girl whimpers)

78
00:05:40,493 --> 00:05:41,620
(Engine starts)

79
00:05:49,803 --> 00:05:53,476
I told you, Tucker. I'm a zero with the ladies.

80
00:05:55,272 --> 00:05:56,734
They hate my face!

81
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,653
Come on.

82
00:06:00,616 --> 00:06:02,661
(J` Uptempo bluegrass)

83
00:06:05,374 --> 00:06:09,550
I ain't like you, Tucker, you know?
I can't talk to the Iadyfolk the way you can.

84
00:06:09,592 --> 00:06:12,096
No one can. I mean, I...

85
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:16,270
I always get all stupid, and my hands get
clammy, and I just act like a big fat idiot.

86
00:06:16,312 --> 00:06:20,028
You know what your problem is?
You got an inferiority complex.

87
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:21,615
No, I don't.

88
00:06:21,657 --> 00:06:23,326
- Yeah, yeah.
- No.

89
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:26,666
Let me tell you something, life is short.
You got to go after what you want.

90
00:06:26,707 --> 00:06:28,043
Mm-hm.

91
00:06:28,085 --> 00:06:31,467
Cos it sure as hell
ain't gonna just fall right in your lap.

92
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:33,136
- That's true, I reckon.
- Aw, shit.

93
00:06:33,179 --> 00:06:35,642
- What are you doing?
- Shit, shit. VVe got a cop.

94
00:06:35,684 --> 00:06:37,228
- (Siren)
- Oh, I got you.

95
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,485
I got a rag. Move your arm.
You spilled beer all over your crotch.

96
00:06:40,568 --> 00:06:42,488
All right, he's pulling over.

97
00:06:43,365 --> 00:06:44,701
- Get up, Dale.
- I can't.

98
00:06:44,742 --> 00:06:47,414
- Dale, he's coming.
- No, it's stuck on my sleeve.

99
00:06:47,456 --> 00:06:48,792
- Get up.
- My hand is stuck on...

100
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:51,423
Un-stuck it, then.
He's out of his car.

101
00:06:51,464 --> 00:06:53,259
(Dale) He's out of his car?
(Tucker) He's coming.

102
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:55,054
- Tucker!
- Get it...

103
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,642
(Dale breathing heavily)

104
00:06:59,855 --> 00:07:01,274
Yeah.

105
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:05,783
- Howdy, Officer.
- Hey.

106
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:09,415
- It's a beautiful day, isn't it?
- (Dale) Yeah.

107
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:10,500
Licence, please.

108
00:07:11,336 --> 00:07:15,385
Uh, I lost my wallet a couple weeks back.
New one is in the mail.

109
00:07:17,973 --> 00:07:19,517
Temporary.

110
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,188
Where you two headed?

111
00:07:21,229 --> 00:07:24,487
We're headed to our vacation home
up by Morris Lake.

112
00:07:26,156 --> 00:07:28,535
I sank every penny I had into it.

113
00:07:28,577 --> 00:07:32,084
Me and Dale here, we're gonna go fix 'er up,
maybe do a little fishin'.

114
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,048
- Do a little fishin'.
- He's been striking out with the ladies.

115
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,971
I figured a little man time
might do him some good.

116
00:07:38,889 --> 00:07:44,900
There ain't nothing up there but pain and
suffering on a scale you can't even imagine.

117
00:07:49,284 --> 00:07:51,621
I pulled you over cos
you got a broken turn signal.

118
00:07:51,664 --> 00:07:53,333
Oh, yes, sir.

119
00:07:54,544 --> 00:07:56,171
See that you, uh...

120
00:07:58,510 --> 00:07:59,762
get that fixed.

121
00:07:59,846 --> 00:08:01,766
That was very helpful.

122
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:11,535
- Man, that was tense.
- (whispers) That dude's weird.

123
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:12,829
There he goes.

124
00:08:13,706 --> 00:08:15,000
Bye _

125
00:08:16,002 --> 00:08:18,757
God, would you look at him?
You know what his problem is?

126
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,764
He was jealous because
he can't afford a place of his own.

127
00:08:21,805 --> 00:08:24,060
Ah.VVe||...

128
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:27,566
(Grunts) Here's to the good life, huh?

129
00:08:29,277 --> 00:08:31,949
- Oh, yeah.
- To the good life, man.

130
00:08:47,229 --> 00:08:51,069
(Dale) I mean, what's a parasite?
Oh, look at this little truck right here!

131
00:08:51,112 --> 00:08:53,909
(Tucker) I know, I know.
(Dale) Is that ours?

132
00:08:53,951 --> 00:08:55,913
(Dale) Wow. And another one right there.

133
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
Oh, my God.

134
00:09:16,953 --> 00:09:18,414
It's perfect!

135
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:21,295
- And what did they call this, a fixer-upper?
- Yeah.

136
00:09:22,547 --> 00:09:25,178
- All right, let's go check it out inside.
- Yeah.

137
00:09:25,219 --> 00:09:28,434
- I can't believe this is ours! Oh, my God!
- (Laughs)

138
00:09:34,403 --> 00:09:36,450
(Flies buzzing)

139
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:39,705
- \N'ell, it's just a little dusty is all.
- It's a mansion!

140
00:09:39,747 --> 00:09:41,751
(Both laugh)

141
00:09:50,727 --> 00:09:54,734
Whoever used to live here must have been
an archaeologist or something.

142
00:09:54,776 --> 00:09:57,531
Yeah, archae... Yeah.

143
00:09:57,572 --> 00:10:00,746
Look at this.
Nlust have been a real news junkie, too.

144
00:10:06,715 --> 00:10:12,811
Chubby's Chili Dog Depot?
Buy three, get two free. No expiration date.

145
00:10:12,853 --> 00:10:16,109
- All right.
- Score!

146
00:10:16,151 --> 00:10:20,117
Tucker, look! They got my favourite
board game here, too. (Laughs)

147
00:10:20,159 --> 00:10:23,875
You know what?
I tell you something, Dale.

148
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:27,465
I cannot believe that I am standing
in my own vacation home right now.

149
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,718
You know something? (Sniffs)

150
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,142
Dreams really do come true.

151
00:10:33,184 --> 00:10:34,436
- Look out!
- (Creaking)

152
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:38,861
- VVhoa!
- (Tucker) VVe||, I guess we should fix that.

153
00:10:38,903 --> 00:10:41,157
Yeah, that's a good idea.

154
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:44,706
You can get off me now.

155
00:10:45,374 --> 00:10:48,296
If you have a reoccurring dream about
sucking a dick but never do it, are you gay?

156
00:10:48,338 --> 00:10:49,882
- (Both) Yes.
- Really?

157
00:10:49,924 --> 00:10:51,092
- Guys!
- Are you serious?

158
00:10:51,134 --> 00:10:53,599
- What?
- You guys want to hear a scary story?

159
00:10:53,641 --> 00:10:55,894
(All) No!
(Boy 1) Chuck, no.

160
00:10:55,936 --> 00:10:57,773
- Absolutely not.
- That's not funny.

161
00:10:57,814 --> 00:11:00,862
- (Boy 2) You're such a liar.
- It happened to my cousins, I think.

162
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:05,079
Now, do you fuckers
want to hear a real story? Huh?

163
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:13,469
This story happened right here,
right in these very woods.

164
00:11:15,724 --> 00:11:17,937
It was 20 years ago today.

165
00:11:23,823 --> 00:11:25,702
The Memorial Day Massacre.

166
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:31,170
How a bunch of college kids...
just like us...

167
00:11:31,212 --> 00:11:33,925
they came out here to have a good time...

168
00:11:34,969 --> 00:11:41,691
but little did they know that they weren't
the only ones in these here woods.

169
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:44,571
(J' Technotronic: Pump Up The Jam)

170
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:47,243
J` Pump it up
J` While your feet are stompin’

171
00:11:47,285 --> 00:11:49,247
J` And the jam is pumpin’...

(Boy) Get another one! Come on!

00:12:00,143 --> 00:12:02,899
(J` Country)
J` I’m gonna meet my maker

178
00:12:02,982 --> 00:12:05,570
J` I ain’t afraid to die

179
00:12:05,612 --> 00:12:09,955
- Hey, what the hell are you doing?
- Yeah, put that back on.

180
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,251
No, no.
This is cool, I like this.

181
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,383
(All screaming)

182
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:37,299
(Shrieks)

183
00:12:52,786 --> 00:12:55,542
Only one person lived to tell this story.

184
00:12:56,878 --> 00:12:59,090
The rest of them just disappeared...

185
00:13:00,384 --> 00:13:03,307
and their bodies are buried beneath us.

186
00:13:05,854 --> 00:13:09,068
Hey! Hey! There's a lake back there.

187
00:13:09,109 --> 00:13:11,197
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

188
00:13:11,238 --> 00:13:13,743
- I do. (Laughs)
- Yeah.

189
00:13:13,785 --> 00:13:17,125
- All right.
- (Boy) I'm not getting naked.

(Belches)

192
00:13:26,226 --> 00:13:28,272
(Dale) Uh... That's OK, Tuck.

193
00:13:28,314 --> 00:13:30,109
You take that. That's yours.

194
00:13:31,486 --> 00:13:33,782
That's why you're never gonna
get ahead in life.

195
00:13:33,824 --> 00:13:36,538
It's cos you don't stick up for yourself.

196
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:41,381
Do not even think about it.

197
00:13:41,423 --> 00:13:43,885
- But you just said...
- Are you kidding me?

198
00:13:44,553 --> 00:13:46,098
- OW!
- (Tucker) Are you serious?

199
00:13:48,059 --> 00:13:49,104
VVhat'd I just say?

200
00:13:49,146 --> 00:13:52,819
- You said I gotta stick up for myself.
- I said, "Don't even think about it", though.

201
00:13:52,861 --> 00:13:54,489
That was the last thing I said.

202
00:14:00,543 --> 00:14:01,670
(Rustling)

203
00:14:01,754 --> 00:14:02,797
Hello?

204
00:14:04,008 --> 00:14:06,304
Is someone there?

205
00:14:06,971 --> 00:14:08,307
Guys?

206
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:14,486
(Taps) Yargh!

207
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:17,408
God, Chad! What the hell are you doing?

208
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:20,455
- You are such an asshole.
- Come on, that was funny.

209
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:21,959
No, it wasn't.

210
00:14:22,001 --> 00:14:24,506
You got nothing to worry about, Allie.
It's just me.

211
00:14:24,547 --> 00:14:26,468
You totally freaked me out.

212
00:14:28,221 --> 00:14:30,433
You know, you can drop the act now.

213
00:14:31,268 --> 00:14:34,483
- What act?
- Like you're better than everyone else.

214
00:14:35,902 --> 00:14:37,864
- I don't think...
- Yeah, you do.

215
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,079
But that's OK, Allie, because I get it.

216
00:14:41,871 --> 00:14:44,878
I mean, you are better than everyone else.

217
00:14:46,423 --> 00:14:48,176
You and I, Allie...

218
00:14:48,218 --> 00:14:51,891
are cut from a different cloth.
You know what I mean?

219
00:14:51,933 --> 00:14:55,023
- I'm not... I...
- All I'm saying is...

220
00:14:57,193 --> 00:15:00,867
I'm glad that we have this chance
to get to know each other better.

221
00:15:03,956 --> 00:15:05,711
Chad, you're drunk.

222
00:15:05,753 --> 00:15:09,175
That's a good thing. It lowers my inhibitions.

223
00:15:10,762 --> 00:15:12,264
OK, uh...

224
00:15:12,306 --> 00:15:14,602
- Come on, stop.
- Why?

225
00:15:14,643 --> 00:15:16,354
Why? Why stop?

226
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,070
We're perfect for each other.

227
00:15:21,157 --> 00:15:24,830
Let's talk about this later.
I'm gonna go catch up with everyone.

228
00:15:24,914 --> 00:15:26,917
Come on, Allie. Come on...

229
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,380
(Squealing, laughing)

230
00:15:29,422 --> 00:15:32,261
(Girl) Oh, it's so cold!
(Boy) Here we go!

231
00:15:32,303 --> 00:15:34,224
(\/Vhooping)

232
00:15:34,265 --> 00:15:36,102
VVhat's that all about?

233
00:15:38,022 --> 00:15:40,945
(Tucker) I don't know,
but I think we should go check it out.

234
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,157
No. No, Tuck, you know what?

235
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,079
My guess would be that they
don't really want to see us right now.

236
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:49,838
- Yeah, I kind of want to see them.
- No, no.

237
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,509
What the hell are you doing?

238
00:15:55,598 --> 00:15:56,683
- Damn it, Dale!
- What?

239
00:15:56,724 --> 00:15:59,272
I'm not gonna go around
one more time with you on this.

240
00:15:59,355 --> 00:16:01,151
- OK.
- Hush.

241
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:05,659
(Girl in distance)
Whoo-hoo! I love camping!

242
00:16:07,788 --> 00:16:09,207
(Whispers) Look.

243
00:16:12,715 --> 00:16:14,593
Oh.

244
00:16:20,061 --> 00:16:21,147
- Tucker!
- Shush!

245
00:16:21,189 --> 00:16:22,316
(Gasps and screams)

246
00:16:22,357 --> 00:16:23,777
(Both scream)

247
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:28,411
God damn it, Dale!
What the hell is the matter with you?

248
00:16:28,453 --> 00:16:30,081
|\/Ie? VVhat did I do?

249
00:16:30,123 --> 00:16:33,379
When you see a college girl prancing
around in front of you half-naked,

250
00:16:33,421 --> 00:16:37,846
- you do not yell out my name.
- Well, you were being a Peeping Tom.

251
00:16:37,888 --> 00:16:40,559
You are hopeless,
do you know that? You're hopeless.

252
00:16:43,357 --> 00:16:44,652
(Dale) She didn't come up yet.

253
00:16:46,446 --> 00:16:48,242
- Tuck, paddle.
- Oh, Jesus.

254

- VVhoa, whoa, Dale!

257
00:17:02,978 --> 00:17:06,945
(Dale, grunting)
Help me get her in the boat! Come on!

258
00:17:07,779 --> 00:17:09,240
(Tucker) Get her legs!

259
00:17:09,282 --> 00:17:11,829
Oh! No!

260
00:17:11,871 --> 00:17:14,834
- Hey, we got your friend!

00:17:14,876 --> 00:17:18,466
- They got Allison! Come on!

00:17:20,345 --> 00:17:21,598
(Tucker) Hey!

263
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:25,521
We got your friend! Why the hell
are they running away? Hey!

264
00:17:25,563 --> 00:17:29,404
Doesn't matter, Tucker, we gotta get her
back to the cabin. Come on, let's row.

265
00:17:29,446 --> 00:17:32,035
- Shit!
- Oh, man.

266
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:35,499
- (Thud)
- Shit.

267
00:17:36,292 --> 00:17:38,254
Chad! Chad!

269
00:17:40,509 --> 00:17:42,722
- What hillbillies?
- From the store!

270
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:44,683
(Panting) They captured Allison!

271
00:17:54,662 --> 00:17:55,872
Allie!

272
00:17:55,914 --> 00:17:57,208

(Allison gasps)

278
00:18:29,437 --> 00:18:31,524
(Hushed) Oh, God! No.

279
00:18:31,566 --> 00:18:35,824
- (Sobs) No, please! No, please, don't...
- Don't...don't cry.

280
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,243
Please don't cut me open!

281
00:18:37,285 --> 00:18:38,538
(G rowl S)

282
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:43,797
Oh! It's the pancakes! You hate pancakes!
I'll go make you something else. I'll just...

283
00:18:43,839 --> 00:18:45,886
- (Breathing heavily)
- Doesn't like pancakes.

284
00:18:45,969 --> 00:18:49,267
Should have asked her if she liked
pancakes. Big fat stupid idiot!

285
00:18:50,978 --> 00:18:52,815
Pa... Pancakes?

286
00:18:55,904 --> 00:18:57,074
Allison!

287
00:18:57,115 --> 00:18:59,286
I don't understand.
Where do you think they took her?

288
00:18:59,328 --> 00:19:03,001
- Maybe they took her to the hospital.
- You don't get it, do you?

289
00:19:03,043 --> 00:19:05,047
Chuck, tell him what you saw.

290
00:19:05,089 --> 00:19:08,513
Well, it was really dark,
but it looked like one ofthe guys was...

291
00:19:08,554 --> 00:19:10,474
|ike...eating her face off.

292
00:19:11,685 --> 00:19:13,522
That is so disgusting.

293
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,693
Not to sound too cliché,
but shouldn't we go to the police?

294
00:19:15,734 --> 00:19:17,362
And just leave Allison with them?

295
00:19:17,404 --> 00:19:19,367
If they already ate her,
what difference does it make?

296
00:19:19,409 --> 00:19:22,748
We don't need the police.
We can handle this on our own.

297
00:19:22,832 --> 00:19:26,880
Vvhat if I go? It's my dad's truck. He told me
I was the only one allowed to drive it.

298
00:19:26,922 --> 00:19:28,801
Fine. You wanna go, Chuck? Then just go.

299
00:19:28,884 --> 00:19:31,765
OK, awesome. I'll be back in a jiffy, I swear.

300
00:19:32,392 --> 00:19:35,230
That's such bullshit.
Why does he get to go?

301
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:46,377
Hey, guys!
You better come look at this.

302
00:19:50,301 --> 00:19:52,306
What is this place?

303
00:19:52,348 --> 00:19:55,812
It's just a cabin.
It doesn't mean they're psycho killers.

304
00:19:55,854 --> 00:19:58,942
Oh, yeah? Then why don't you
go in there and talk to them?

305
00:19:58,984 --> 00:20:00,946
All right. Maybe I will.

306
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:05,790
I said maybe.

307
00:20:26,287 --> 00:20:31,881
There you go. Please don't tell me
that you hate eggs and bacon.

308
00:20:34,302 --> 00:20:36,558
VVha-VVhat am I doing here?

309
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:39,856
Oh, you don't remember?
OK. Uh...

310
00:20:39,897 --> 00:20:42,527
VVe||, me and Tucker...

311
00:20:42,569 --> 00:20:44,865
I mean, uh, I and Tuck...

312
00:20:45,615 --> 00:20:46,618
VVe||...

313
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:52,463
- Tucker and I brung you here last night.
- Why?

314
00:20:52,504 --> 00:20:55,385
Because you were about
to go swimming with your friends,

315
00:20:55,427 --> 00:20:58,349
and you climbed up on a bunch of rocks,
and you fell and banged your head

316
00:20:58,391 --> 00:21:00,854
and then you fell into the water,
and then...

317
00:21:00,896 --> 00:21:03,358
I dove in and rescued you.

318
00:21:04,527 --> 00:21:08,953
- VVait, you...you were spying on us?
- No. No, what? No!

319
00:21:08,995 --> 00:21:11,208
No, we weren't spying.
No, I swear to God, no, no.

320
00:21:11,249 --> 00:21:13,962
VVe were out there fishin'. OK?
I didn't... VVe didn't see...

321
00:21:14,004 --> 00:21:16,927
I didn't see...
Maybe Tucker might have seen a little...

322
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:18,471
Where are my friends?

323
00:21:18,513 --> 00:21:22,605
- They ran off into the woods.
- They just left me?

324
00:21:22,647 --> 00:21:24,942
Yeah, but don't be mad at them.

325
00:21:24,984 --> 00:21:28,156
Some people just aren't any good in a crisis,

326
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:31,080
and that's why Tucker and I brung you here,

327
00:21:31,122 --> 00:21:33,918
hoping that they would
come get you in the morning.

328
00:21:35,964 --> 00:21:38,927
I didn't have any girlie clothes, so...

329
00:21:38,969 --> 00:21:40,848
|t's OK, I...

330
00:21:40,889 --> 00:21:43,311
I never really had much fashion sense,
anyway.

331
00:21:43,353 --> 00:21:45,732
- Me neither.
- (Laughs) Yeah.

332
00:21:45,774 --> 00:21:47,987
- (Laughs)
- (Grovvls)

333
00:21:48,028 --> 00:21:52,413
That's my dog, Jangers. He looks mean,
but he's just a big old marshmallow.

334
00:21:52,455 --> 00:21:54,583
You can just pet him round the nose.

335
00:21:55,334 --> 00:21:56,753
- He's drooling.
- I know.

336
00:21:57,714 --> 00:22:01,804
Anymfay, um...I'm sorry
about all the mess around here.

337
00:22:01,847 --> 00:22:04,936
Tucker just bought this place,
and, uh...you know...

338
00:22:06,105 --> 00:22:09,528
Yeah, I'm sure it doesn't look like much
to a high-class girl like you,

339
00:22:09,612 --> 00:22:14,246
but we've always just had sort of
a dream to have our own vacation home.

340
00:22:15,207 --> 00:22:16,959
But, uh...anyv\/ay...

341
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:20,884
you should relax and rest, OK?

342
00:22:20,926 --> 00:22:23,430
Hey, what's...
what's your name?

343
00:22:23,472 --> 00:22:25,142
Uh...

344
00:22:25,184 --> 00:22:28,065
It's Tale. Ducker.
My name...

345
00:22:28,982 --> 00:22:31,529
- My name is Dale.
- I'm Allison.

346
00:22:31,571 --> 00:22:33,741
But my...
my friends call me Allie.

347
00:22:33,783 --> 00:22:37,792
Well, it's a real pleasure to meet you,
A||ie...son.

348
00:22:37,834 --> 00:22:41,005
And if you need anything else,
you just holler for me.

349
00:22:41,047 --> 00:22:43,009
I'll be right in the little room here.

350
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:47,352
- Uh, Dale?
- Yeah.

351
00:22:48,312 --> 00:22:50,566
Do you guys have
anything to do around here?

352
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:52,194
Do you like board games?

353
00:22:54,365 --> 00:22:56,243
What kind do you have?

354
00:22:57,453 --> 00:23:00,752
We got this one right here.
|t's my favourite. Trivi-Up.

355
00:23:03,717 --> 00:23:05,636
- Yes!
- Come on, four out of seven.

356
00:23:05,678 --> 00:23:07,473
No way, dude. You lost.

357
00:23:08,266 --> 00:23:11,315
Just shut up and walk, bitch.

358
00:23:17,284 --> 00:23:19,371
(Birdsong)

359
00:23:24,632 --> 00:23:26,594
Goddamn Romeo.

360
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,684
(Sighs) Oh, well.

361
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,284
(Chainsaw starts, falters)

362
00:23:43,210 --> 00:23:44,963
(Chainsaw starts)

363
00:23:45,004 --> 00:23:46,675
(Caws)

364
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,302
Oh, Jesus.

365
00:23:48,344 --> 00:23:49,846
(Chainsaw buzzing)

366
00:24:04,585 --> 00:24:06,087
Aargh! Aargh! Argh!

367
00:24:06,129 --> 00:24:08,383
Run! Run for your lives!

368
00:24:08,466 --> 00:24:10,762
Yargh! (Howls)

369
00:24:11,598 --> 00:24:13,684
(Girls screaming)

370
00:24:17,818 --> 00:24:20,114
- (Screaming)
- (Bees buzzing)

371
00:24:21,366 --> 00:24:22,994
(Panting)

372
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,496
(Screaming)

373
00:24:38,441 --> 00:24:39,568
(Screams)

374
00:24:40,403 --> 00:24:42,574
(Shrieks)

375
00:24:42,616 --> 00:24:44,661
(G roans)

376
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:09,000
Here we go. Big roll. Five.

377
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:11,630
(Hushed) One, two, three, four, five.

378
00:25:11,672 --> 00:25:13,384
OK, shoot.

379
00:25:14,845 --> 00:25:17,182
Who was the fifth President
of the United States?

380
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:19,060
Oh, that's too easy. That's James |\/Ionroe.

381
00:25:20,439 --> 00:25:23,737
God, you are right again. You are killing me.

382
00:25:23,778 --> 00:25:25,991
I know. I'm sorry about that. I just...

383
00:25:26,074 --> 00:25:28,997
I got this weird brain
where I'm dumb as a stump,

384
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:32,713
- but I remember everything I ever heard.
- That sounds pretty smart to me.

385
00:25:32,796 --> 00:25:37,138
No, trust me, I'm stupid.
I barely even made it past the third grade.

386
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,266
Oh, that doesn't mean anything.

387
00:25:39,308 --> 00:25:43,067
There's a difference
between education and intellect.

388
00:25:46,364 --> 00:25:48,451
Yeah? (Clears throat)

389
00:25:49,370 --> 00:25:54,213
So, um, what is it that you study in college?

390
00:25:54,254 --> 00:25:56,467
I'm getting my Bachelor's
degree in psychology.

391
00:25:56,509 --> 00:25:58,888
Oh, a Bach... Oh.

392
00:25:59,973 --> 00:26:03,480
So, what kind of work
would you do with that?

393
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:05,567
Oh, I don't know. I, um...

394
00:26:07,029 --> 00:26:08,990
I-I have these stupid dreams.

395
00:26:09,074 --> 00:26:10,619
Dreams are not stupid.

396
00:26:12,372 --> 00:26:18,300
\N'ell, um...I just think that so many of the
major problems and conflicts in the world

397
00:26:18,342 --> 00:26:20,638
are caused by a lack of communication,
you know?

398
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:21,765
- Yeah.
- And I just...

399
00:26:21,807 --> 00:26:25,188
I just always thought that
I'd make a really good therapist.

400
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:26,734
No, don't! Don't!

401
00:26:26,775 --> 00:26:30,825
Yeah, my parents say the same thing.
I should probably just give up.

402
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:35,166
No. I think you could do whatever you want.
It's just, that beam is a little bit rickety.

403
00:26:35,207 --> 00:26:38,048
Yeah, you could have just
pushed that thing right over.

404
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:39,592
Hey, hey.

405
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:42,221
Oh, my God, Tucker,
what happened to your face?

406
00:26:42,263 --> 00:26:44,559
I sawed into a bees' nest.

407
00:26:44,642 --> 00:26:46,938
(Laughs) Why?

408
00:26:47,022 --> 00:26:49,695
I didn't do it on purpose, you idiot.

409
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:52,742
I might have avoided it
if you were out there helping me!

410
00:26:55,706 --> 00:26:56,958
Yeah.

411
00:26:58,377 --> 00:27:00,674
(Whimpers)
VVe came out here to work...

412
00:27:00,716 --> 00:27:03,137
not sit around playing stupid board games!

413
00:27:03,179 --> 00:27:06,101
It was my fault, I...
I suckered him into playing.

414
00:27:06,142 --> 00:27:08,689
No, that's not true. It was my fault.

415
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:12,406
How about I come over there
and pull those stingers out of your face?

416
00:27:12,447 --> 00:27:14,325
Then I'll help you with whatever you want?

417
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:17,706
- All right, I'd like that. Thank you.
- OK.

418
00:27:17,748 --> 00:27:20,629
Let me help.
Wow, they really did a number on you.

419
00:27:20,671 --> 00:27:23,552
- Be careful. Be careful.
- They really got you.

420
00:27:23,593 --> 00:27:24,762
Hi.

421
00:27:24,846 --> 00:27:26,516
I saw your friend out there.

422
00:27:28,854 --> 00:27:33,487
He must be allergic to bees or something,
because he was runnin' like a bat outta hell.

423
00:27:33,571 --> 00:27:37,370
- I should go out there and find them...
- (Dale) No, no! That's... No!

424
00:27:37,412 --> 00:27:41,085
No, you need to rest,
so we'll go find your friends.

425
00:27:41,127 --> 00:27:44,384
- But I can just...
- No. No buts, OK?

426
00:27:44,426 --> 00:27:47,806
We'|| go find your friends. You should relax.
Tucker and Dale are on the case.

427
00:27:47,849 --> 00:27:49,351
Ain't that right, Tucker?

428
00:27:51,229 --> 00:27:52,565
- (Sighs) Yeah.
- Yeah.

429
00:27:52,608 --> 00:27:55,697
- (Tucker) Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah. Good man. OK.

430
00:27:56,741 --> 00:28:00,039
Dale, just...
just be careful, OK?

431
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,335
My friends can be kind of judgmental.

432
00:28:02,376 --> 00:28:04,839
I'm gonna let Tucker
do most of the talking, anymfay.

433
00:28:04,881 --> 00:28:07,970
He can win over just about anybody,
can't you? Real people person.

434
00:28:10,266 --> 00:28:14,024
OK, here we go.
You just relax, OK? Get some rest.

435
00:28:19,576 --> 00:28:21,247
(J' Eerie music)

436
00:28:21,413 --> 00:28:24,962
- They fucking killed him, man.
- They left his body here as a message.

437
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:30,222
- Yeah, "Stay the fuck out of our woods."
- (Sobs) I can't believe this is happening.

438
00:28:30,264 --> 00:28:34,647
Would you fucking quit it with this thing?
It doesn't work out here!

439
00:28:34,689 --> 00:28:35,732
- (G ru nts)
- (Gasps)

440
00:28:35,774 --> 00:28:38,320
We gotta get to the road
and try to catch a ride out of here.

441
00:28:38,362 --> 00:28:42,036
We don't need a ride out of here.
Don't you get it?

442
00:28:42,078 --> 00:28:45,418
This is what it's all about.
It's us against them.

443
00:28:45,459 --> 00:28:48,381
Survival of the fittest!

444
00:28:49,844 --> 00:28:52,682
- (Chad laughs)
- What are you doing, man?

445
00:28:52,765 --> 00:28:54,059
That's my whole face.

446
00:28:54,143 --> 00:28:56,522
You have serious issues, you know that?

447
00:28:56,564 --> 00:29:00,321
- Quick. Somebody's coming.
- Oh, shit. Oh, shit...

448
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:03,954
(Dale) And the answer was,
"isosceles triangle". You know what that is?

449
00:29:03,996 --> 00:29:05,999
(Tucker) Is it a triangle?
(Dale) Yeah.

450
00:29:06,041 --> 00:29:08,170
Tucker, you would have been proud of me.

451
00:29:08,212 --> 00:29:11,719
A smart little college girl like that,
and I was beating the crap out of her.

452
00:29:11,761 --> 00:29:13,473
- (Sighs) Dale.
- Yeah?

453
00:29:13,515 --> 00:29:16,311
You beat the crap outta everybody.
There's something wrong with your brain.

454
00:29:16,353 --> 00:29:17,980
I know. You keep telling me that.

455
00:29:18,022 --> 00:29:22,490
Tell you what, when we get back I'll finish
her off real quick then we'll get back to work.

456
00:29:22,532 --> 00:29:24,619
(Hushed) They're gonna kill her!

457
00:29:25,829 --> 00:29:29,878
- Somebody was just here.
- Oh, yeah. It's a hatchet.

458
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,801
College kids!

459
00:29:34,596 --> 00:29:38,771
- (Shouts) College kids!
- Say it again. Louder.

460
00:29:38,813 --> 00:29:42,361
- (Sighs) College kids!
- Hey, college kids!

461
00:29:42,403 --> 00:29:45,660
- (Gasping)
- College kids!

462
00:29:45,702 --> 00:29:47,246
(Dale) I don't see 'em.

463
00:29:48,415 --> 00:29:50,209
(Tucker) They must have run off.

464
00:29:50,627 --> 00:29:55,721
Well, hmm... Maybe vve could leave
them a note in case they come back.

465
00:29:55,762 --> 00:29:57,015
All right. With what?

466
00:29:58,100 --> 00:30:01,106
- \N'ell, this'll work.
- All right. Please, hurry up.

467
00:30:01,148 --> 00:30:05,781
- My face is as hot as a haemorrhoid.
- Yeah, you don't look so good. OK.

468
00:30:05,823 --> 00:30:07,952
- Careful.
- I'm gonna have to etch it in.

469
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:27,281
(\lVood chipper humming)

470
00:30:30,537 --> 00:30:31,790
(Dale sings)

471
00:30:31,831 --> 00:30:34,921
J` Uh-huh, I got my cootie shot

472
00:30:34,963 --> 00:30:37,217
J` You think that girl is hot...

473
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,639
- Dale?
- Yeah? Huh...

474
00:30:40,599 --> 00:30:43,897
- Did you guys find my friends?
- Uh, whoa.

475
00:30:43,939 --> 00:30:45,650
VVhoa.

476
00:30:45,692 --> 00:30:48,071
- VVhat?
- Huh? VVhat?

477
00:30:48,154 --> 00:30:50,743
Your friends? No, no.
Uh, we left them a note.

478
00:30:50,827 --> 00:30:52,956
They should be by here any minute.

479
00:30:55,753 --> 00:30:58,967
- What are you doing?
- Oh, |'m digging a shitter hole.

480
00:30:59,009 --> 00:31:01,138
I'm digging a crap... crapper hole.
It's a...

481
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:03,893
It's a hole.
It's for the shithouse. Craphouse...

482
00:31:03,935 --> 00:31:06,607
- Outhouse hole.
- An outhouse hole.

483
00:31:07,358 --> 00:31:09,989
- Right. You mind if I help?
- What? No!

484
00:31:10,031 --> 00:31:13,622
No, no, it's not work for a pretty...
for a girl like you. That's...

485
00:31:13,663 --> 00:31:15,374
Oh.

486
00:31:15,416 --> 00:31:18,547
I grew up on a farm.
It was either help out or get out.

487
00:31:18,589 --> 00:31:19,966
That's a good rule.

488
00:31:20,008 --> 00:31:22,554
Yeah. So I've done this before,
believe it or not.

489
00:31:22,596 --> 00:31:23,641
Yeah.

490
00:31:29,818 --> 00:31:32,114
You gonna help,
or just stand there staring at me?

491
00:31:32,156 --> 00:31:35,705
- Uh... No, I'm gonna help. I'll just...
- I can't dig this on my own.

492
00:31:35,789 --> 00:31:37,249
Yeah, yeah.

493
00:31:38,795 --> 00:31:41,049
- Yeah, you're doing a good job.
- Thank you.

494
00:31:46,226 --> 00:31:47,269
(G ru nts)

495
00:31:51,443 --> 00:31:54,116
(Boy) That sick fuck.
He's making her dig her own grave.

496
00:31:54,157 --> 00:31:55,827
VVe don't have much time.

497
00:31:56,830 --> 00:31:59,418
- Does everybody have their weapons?
- All set, man.

498
00:31:59,459 --> 00:32:03,466
All right, you guys go around, get the guy
at the wood chipper. You take the big guy.

499
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:09,646
I'm gonna just chill right here.

500
00:32:14,029 --> 00:32:15,741
(Dale) OK, one more load and we're done.

501
00:32:16,743 --> 00:32:20,167
Hey, come on, get out. Here.

502
00:32:22,671 --> 00:32:24,174
Now!

503
00:32:25,092 --> 00:32:26,386
Huh?

504
00:32:27,930 --> 00:32:30,352
Oh, good, look, your friends are here. Hey!

505
00:32:30,394 --> 00:32:31,521
(Screaming)

506
00:32:31,563 --> 00:32:32,940
Dale!

507
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:37,407
(Shrieks)

508
00:32:38,284 --> 00:32:41,708
- (Screams) Oh, God!
- (Groans)

509
00:32:59,074 --> 00:33:00,786
(Screaming)

510
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:09,469
(Screams)

511
00:33:13,144 --> 00:33:15,189
(Chipper engine dies)

512
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:17,527
(Panting)

513
00:33:19,906 --> 00:33:21,284
(Whimpers) Are you OK?

514
00:33:25,835 --> 00:33:27,796
(Panting) Allison, say something!

515
00:33:28,757 --> 00:33:32,180
- (Shouts) Tucker! Tucker!
- Holy mother of God!

516
00:33:32,263 --> 00:33:34,392
You'|| never beli... What happened to you?

517
00:33:35,687 --> 00:33:37,900
- Are you OK?
- What happened to me?

518
00:33:38,902 --> 00:33:43,452
Some kid, he just hucked himself
right into the wood chipper!

519
00:33:43,494 --> 00:33:45,956
- What?
- Headfirst right into the wood chipper!

520
00:33:45,999 --> 00:33:49,464
From his shoes and pants, it looked like
it might have been one of the college kids.

521
00:33:49,506 --> 00:33:51,217
What the hell happened to her?

522
00:33:51,258 --> 00:33:54,348
She got knocked out and fell
in the shitter hole right next to me.

523
00:33:54,389 --> 00:33:56,226
Is that your blood?
What? No.

524
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:59,608
No, it's college kid blood. One of them
suckers came running out of nowhere,

525
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:02,029
speared himself through the gut
and died right on top of me!

526
00:34:02,071 --> 00:34:03,991
- Holy crap.
- I know!

527
00:34:04,033 --> 00:34:05,285
Calm down. Don't cry.

528
00:34:05,327 --> 00:34:06,371
- Calm down!
- OK.

529
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:08,793
- Get a hold of yourself!
- (Breathes deeply)

530
00:34:11,172 --> 00:34:14,595
All right...
I know what this is.

531
00:34:14,637 --> 00:34:17,642
- What?
- This is a suicide pact.

532
00:34:17,725 --> 00:34:19,730
- It's a what?
- These kids are coming out here,

533
00:34:19,772 --> 00:34:23,612
- and killing themselves all over the woods.
- My God, that makes so much sense.

534
00:34:23,654 --> 00:34:26,285
Holy shit. We have got to hide
all ofthe sharp objects!

535
00:34:26,326 --> 00:34:29,331
You know what else?
I think they're trying to kill her, too.

536
00:34:29,373 --> 00:34:31,336
Yeah. Think about it.

537
00:34:31,378 --> 00:34:35,302
That's why they acted so funny after
we saved her, because they want her dead.

538
00:34:36,596 --> 00:34:39,935
- Why?
- I don't know. I don't know.

539
00:34:39,977 --> 00:34:43,276
It's good that you and I don't know -
if we knew they'd want to kill us, too.

540
00:34:43,318 --> 00:34:45,196
Yeah, that's a good point.

541
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:47,784
OK, so what... what do we...

542
00:34:47,826 --> 00:34:50,206
VVe go to the police?

543
00:34:50,289 --> 00:34:52,001
- Call the police?
- Yeah.

544
00:34:53,086 --> 00:34:55,841
- And tell 'em what?
- Uh...we'll tell 'em what happened.

545
00:34:55,883 --> 00:34:58,137
(Laughs) That's a good idea, Dale.

546
00:34:58,221 --> 00:35:02,437
"Oh, hidey-ho, Officer.
VVe've had a doozy of a day.

547
00:35:02,479 --> 00:35:05,819
"There we were, minding our own business,
doing some chores around the house,

548
00:35:05,861 --> 00:35:08,199
"when kids started killing themselves
all over my property."

549
00:35:08,241 --> 00:35:09,993
Well, that's what happened, Tucker!

550
00:35:10,035 --> 00:35:13,208
You would have to be a moron
to believe that, Dale.

551
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,467
It doesn't matter what happened. What
matters is what looks like what happened.

552
00:35:17,509 --> 00:35:21,641
And what looks like what happened...
is pretty nasty.

553
00:35:21,683 --> 00:35:23,478
(Sighs) So what the hell do we do?

554
00:35:24,814 --> 00:35:26,776
VVe gotta clean this mess up.

555
00:35:27,611 --> 00:35:30,074
- Right now.
- OK.

556
00:35:33,622 --> 00:35:36,086
- (Sobs)
- You shou|dn't be smoking anyway, Chloe.

557
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:37,171
It's not good for you.

558
00:35:37,255 --> 00:35:39,217
Fucking dying isn't good for you, either,

559
00:35:39,259 --> 00:35:42,139
but that doesn't
seem to be stopping anybody!

560
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:45,812
We gotta get out of here. I mean,
what the hell are vve still doing here?

561
00:35:45,855 --> 00:35:47,650
How are we gonna get outta here?

562
00:35:47,692 --> 00:35:50,155
Dickvvad over here sent Chuck off
with the truck!

563
00:35:50,196 --> 00:35:51,657
\N'ell, then let's walk.

564
00:35:51,699 --> 00:35:53,912
- 40 miles?
- You should have thought of that

565
00:35:53,953 --> 00:35:56,834
- before you wore your stripper shoes.
- VVIII y'all just shut up?

566
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:59,214
Listen, we gotta work together, OK?

567
00:35:59,256 --> 00:36:02,011
We never shou|d've come out here.
Whose stupid idea was this?

568
00:36:02,053 --> 00:36:03,096
Chad!

569
00:36:06,728 --> 00:36:10,152
You guys are all a bunch of fucking pussies,
you know that?

570
00:36:10,194 --> 00:36:14,117
I mean, a few little tiny murders...

571
00:36:14,201 --> 00:36:16,372
and everyone just freaks out.

572
00:36:17,582 --> 00:36:19,837
But do you know how lucky you all are, huh?

573
00:36:19,879 --> 00:36:23,886
- Huh?
- What the fuck are you talking about, man?

574
00:36:23,929 --> 00:36:27,936
How many people do you think
get a chance for something like this?

575
00:36:28,896 --> 00:36:32,279
- The chance to die?
- The chance to live.

576
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:36,828
To be free from people always
telling you what you can and can't do.

577
00:36:36,869 --> 00:36:40,376
There's no rules out here.
It's us against them.

578
00:36:41,295 --> 00:36:44,760
And if you don't think
you can handle that, well...

579
00:36:46,556 --> 00:36:48,017
maybe you deserve to die.

580
00:36:48,935 --> 00:36:50,020
(Gasps)

581
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:53,152
That's fucked up.

582
00:36:54,571 --> 00:36:58,036
- (Siren in distance)
- Shh. Y'all hear that?

583
00:36:58,119 --> 00:37:00,791
Chuck got the police!
Come on, you guys, let's go!

584
00:37:00,833 --> 00:37:03,421
No, you don't need the fucking cops!

585
00:37:03,463 --> 00:37:05,718
The cops aren't gonna help us, man.

586
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,769
Don't you fucking idiots know anything?

587
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:12,898
Fuck.

588
00:37:17,699 --> 00:37:21,498
Now, don't you worry.
Your friends are probably fine.

589
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,044
Probably just a little misunderstanding,
that's all.

590
00:37:24,086 --> 00:37:25,799
- Oh, God! Look out!
- (Tyres screech)

591
00:37:25,840 --> 00:37:28,052
- Help us! Help us!
- Chloe?

592
00:37:28,094 --> 00:37:29,347
They're dead!

593
00:37:29,389 --> 00:37:30,808
They died!

594
00:37:30,849 --> 00:37:32,644
(Sheriff) Slow down, now.

595
00:37:32,727 --> 00:37:34,940
- They killed them!
- OK.

596
00:37:34,982 --> 00:37:40,868
Stay calm. \N'ell, why don't you kids climb in
the back seat, and we'll go have a look?

597
00:37:44,375 --> 00:37:46,671
Those stupid fucks.

598
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:56,106
(Coughs, splutters) I don't think
I have the stomach for this, Tuck.

599
00:37:56,148 --> 00:37:59,405
I know.
He's jammed in there pretty good.

600
00:38:01,451 --> 00:38:04,414
- The store better not charge me for this!
- Yup.

601
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:08,212
All right, look, I'm gonna wedge it from
that side, and you pull him out on three.

602
00:38:08,254 --> 00:38:09,423
- OK.
- All right?

603
00:38:10,384 --> 00:38:13,557
- (Squelching)
- One. Two. Three!

604
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:14,976
Argh!

605
00:38:15,060 --> 00:38:18,983
- Oh, Tuck! Oh, take it off! Take it off me!
- OK, help me get it off.

606
00:38:19,067 --> 00:38:22,240
Get it off me. Not on the face!

607
00:38:23,743 --> 00:38:25,120
Oh! I'm gonna barf.

608
00:38:26,415 --> 00:38:28,377
- (Whimpers)
- You're OK, you're OK.

609
00:38:28,418 --> 00:38:31,216
- Here, grab a leg. Grab a leg.
- OK.

610
00:38:31,257 --> 00:38:32,469
Get him over to the truck.

611
00:38:34,639 --> 00:38:37,228
Oh, God. Oh, God.

612
00:38:37,269 --> 00:38:39,482
- He's heavy for half a guy.
- Oh, God.

613
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:45,326
(Siren burst)

614
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:47,957
Oh, shit.

615
00:38:53,133 --> 00:38:55,096
- Let me do the talking.
- That's a good idea.

616
00:38:57,392 --> 00:38:58,853
You kids stay put.

617
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:02,860
I'll handle this.

618
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:06,827
(Dale) Hey.
(Tucker) Hello, Officer.

619
00:39:06,869 --> 00:39:08,872
- Good to see you again.
- Yeah.

620
00:39:11,293 --> 00:39:14,591
- VVe have had a doozy of a day.
- A real doozy.

621
00:39:14,632 --> 00:39:18,140
- Uh, there we were...
- Yup.

622
00:39:18,182 --> 00:39:20,436
- _.minding our own business...
- Yup.

623
00:39:20,478 --> 00:39:23,484
- _.making improvements to my house...
- The new house.

624
00:39:23,525 --> 00:39:25,737
..when, all of a sudden,
out of nowhere,

625
00:39:25,779 --> 00:39:30,581
these kids started killing themselves
all over my property.

626
00:39:30,623 --> 00:39:34,128
This one right here, he dove headfirst
right into the wood chipper,

627
00:39:34,213 --> 00:39:35,465
the woody right back there.

628
00:39:35,507 --> 00:39:40,600
There's another one up over there
who shoved a spear through his gullet.

629
00:39:40,683 --> 00:39:41,852
(Dale) Straight through.

630
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:44,774
I don't know how much experience
you've had with this,

631
00:39:44,816 --> 00:39:48,280
- but we were scared shitless.
- Scared shitless.

632
00:39:56,421 --> 00:40:01,265
You must think that I'm some
kind of moron to believe a story like that.

633
00:40:01,306 --> 00:40:02,935
- No...
-Oh, no.

634
00:40:02,977 --> 00:40:06,316
- No, sir.
- Not a moron, just...open-minded.

635
00:40:06,358 --> 00:40:10,741
Let me get this straight, cos I'm having
trouble understanding something.

636
00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:15,167
- What?
- You say you were just working,

637
00:40:15,208 --> 00:40:21,386
when this...kid...ran up
and stuffed his head into that wood chipper?

638
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:23,475
- That's a fact.
- That is a fact.

639
00:40:23,516 --> 00:40:29,360
And I think maybe they might be
trying to kill the girl that we have inside.

640
00:40:29,402 --> 00:40:30,863
- What girl?
- You know what?

641
00:40:30,905 --> 00:40:34,329
She can maybe explain
the whole thing if, uh...

642
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,293
if I hadn't have knocked her
unconscious with a shovel.

643
00:40:37,335 --> 00:40:39,797
- (Laughs) That's...
- On accident.

644
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:40,925
On accident.

645
00:40:40,966 --> 00:40:45,266
You've got another one inside,
and you say she's unconscious?

646
00:40:45,308 --> 00:40:48,397
- Yeah, she's in my bedroom.
- (Laughs) That's...

647
00:40:49,441 --> 00:40:50,944
(Laughs manically)

648
00:40:52,822 --> 00:40:54,535
You better show me what you done with her.

649
00:40:54,576 --> 00:40:57,749
- Right this way. Let's show him.
- OK, I'm gonna put this leg down.

650
00:40:57,791 --> 00:41:00,379
(Tucker) Great idea.
Why don't you go and show him?

651
00:41:01,464 --> 00:41:02,925
VVait, where is he going?

652
00:41:03,969 --> 00:41:06,683
- No, don't go in there.
- (Tucker) Right this way, Sheriff.

653
00:41:11,108 --> 00:41:12,819
- (Whimpers)
- (Chloe) VVhat's he doing?

654
00:41:13,654 --> 00:41:15,408
Why doesn't he fucking arrest them?

655
00:41:22,714 --> 00:41:25,594
Her eyes are equal, reactive to light.

656
00:41:27,932 --> 00:41:30,437
- At least she's not braindead.
- Oh, thank God.

657
00:41:30,478 --> 00:41:34,862
I told you boys to stay away from this place,
but you just didn't listen, did you?

658
00:41:34,904 --> 00:41:38,285
Now, you're looking at least two counts
of involuntary manslaughter,

659
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:40,415
but you'd be lucky to get that.

660
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:44,672
Officer, do we look like
a couple of psycho killers to you?

661
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:49,725
VVe||, it's...
it's hard to say.

662
00:41:50,476 --> 00:41:52,480
Looks can be deceiving.

663
00:41:52,521 --> 00:41:53,899
- (Both) Oh, don't!
- (\lVood creaks)

664
00:41:53,941 --> 00:41:55,026
(Screams)

665
00:41:57,155 --> 00:41:59,493
Sheriff! You OK?

666
00:42:00,996 --> 00:42:02,040
(Screams)

667
00:42:02,082 --> 00:42:03,542
- Oh, shit!
- (Screams)

668
00:42:03,584 --> 00:42:06,256
(Tucker) Come on!
(Dale) What is going on?

669
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:09,595
- How's he even walking, Tuck?
- He looks like he's gonna walk it off.

670
00:42:09,637 --> 00:42:11,182
(Tucker) He's gonna be fine.

671
00:42:11,224 --> 00:42:12,477
- (|\/Ioaning)
- (Screaming)

672
00:42:17,152 --> 00:42:18,863
(Sheriff) Don't worry, I got it.

673
00:42:21,326 --> 00:42:23,415
- (Radio crackles)
- It's Sher... Sher...

674
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:27,130
Oh, my God! They fucking killed him!

675
00:42:27,171 --> 00:42:29,134
- Unlock the door!
- (All scream)

676
00:42:30,344 --> 00:42:34,060
God damn it, Tucker!
I told you we should have fixed that beam!

677
00:42:34,102 --> 00:42:37,942
You are not putting this on me!
Do you understand me? This is your fault.

678
00:42:37,984 --> 00:42:41,490
In there playing board games
with that little girl when I'm out working!

679
00:42:41,532 --> 00:42:43,786
- (Arguing continues)
- (Kids screaming)

680
00:42:49,214 --> 00:42:51,176
Unlock the fucking door!

681
00:42:51,217 --> 00:42:55,058
(Tucker) If you hadn't been playing
board games with that little girl inside,

682
00:42:55,142 --> 00:42:58,065
we would have had
a little more time to fix the beam!

683
00:42:58,148 --> 00:42:59,233
Heads up.

684
00:42:59,317 --> 00:43:01,446
- Fuck you, you motherfuckers!
- No, no, no!

685
00:43:03,742 --> 00:43:06,038
Oh, you got to take
the safety off on the side there.

686
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:09,879
Don't do...

687
00:43:09,921 --> 00:43:12,384
- (All scream)
- Jesus! Oh, God!

688
00:43:13,928 --> 00:43:16,474
You've got to start being more careful!

689
00:43:19,982 --> 00:43:21,527
(Gunfire continues)

690
00:43:22,821 --> 00:43:25,200
(Dale) I don't think he understands!

691
00:43:26,244 --> 00:43:27,788
(Dane) om

692
00:43:27,830 --> 00:43:29,793
"You gotta take the safety off"?

693
00:43:30,669 --> 00:43:35,386
You're something, Dale. None of this
would have happened if it wasn't for you!

694
00:43:35,428 --> 00:43:36,848
- What?
- That's right!

695
00:43:36,889 --> 00:43:40,313
For being such a goddamn Good Samaritan!
"My God, she's drowning, Tucker.

696
00:43:40,397 --> 00:43:45,072
- "Oh, let's save her." Hell!
- VVell, at least she's still alive.

697
00:43:45,114 --> 00:43:48,202
- Oh, halle-fuckin'-Iujah!
- Don't you dare blame this on her!

698
00:43:48,244 --> 00:43:51,585
I'm not blaming this on her,
I'm blaming this on you!

699
00:43:51,626 --> 00:43:53,171
VVe||, you know what, Tucker?

700
00:43:53,212 --> 00:43:57,262
None of this would have happened
if we hadn't have gone fishin'!

701
00:43:57,304 --> 00:44:00,059
- That isn't even an option.
- I don't even like fishin'!

702
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:01,604
You don't like...

703
00:44:03,816 --> 00:44:07,281
- What do you mean, you don't like fishin'?
- I-I mean...

704
00:44:07,323 --> 00:44:09,494
I like... I like it OK.

705
00:44:09,535 --> 00:44:11,831
You know... I'm sorry.

706
00:44:11,873 --> 00:44:15,714
I'm sorry, Tucker.
Did I hurt your feelings? I'm sorry.

707
00:44:17,343 --> 00:44:19,471
- Yeah, you kinda did.
- (Gunfire)

708
00:44:20,556 --> 00:44:21,935
- Cut it out!
- (Gunfire stops)

709
00:44:21,976 --> 00:44:23,019
(Dog barking)

710
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:26,736
Tucker...

711
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:29,449
where's Jangers?

712
00:44:32,831 --> 00:44:34,459
- Shit.
- Stay here.

713
00:44:35,503 --> 00:44:36,630
Aah! Damn.

714
00:44:37,966 --> 00:44:39,593
(Whimpers) Nuts...

715
00:44:41,222 --> 00:44:43,810
- Hey, hillbilly! Your move.
- (Jangers whines)

716
00:44:43,852 --> 00:44:45,480
Oh, son of a bitch!

717
00:44:45,522 --> 00:44:47,985
- They got my dog.
- Shit!

718
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:50,239
(Sniffs) VVe gotta do something.

719
00:44:50,281 --> 00:44:53,871
- Did you bring that nail gun in here?
- Yeah. Why?

720
00:44:55,416 --> 00:44:57,629
Stay low. Stay low to the ground.
Keep your hat!

721
00:45:04,349 --> 00:45:05,685
(Grunts) Oh.

722
00:45:05,727 --> 00:45:07,523
(Panting) All right.

723
00:45:08,525 --> 00:45:10,696
- Cover me.
- Uh...

724
00:45:10,738 --> 00:45:12,866
I ain't never shot at nobody before.

725
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:17,834
If it helps,
think of 'em like moving two-by-fours.

726
00:45:17,876 --> 00:45:19,588
- (\/Vhoosh, thud)
- VVhoa!

727
00:45:20,632 --> 00:45:23,888
- (Hushed) \.Nhoa!
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

728
00:45:23,930 --> 00:45:26,016
Now, you create a distraction.

729
00:45:27,394 --> 00:45:29,398
I'm gonna go out the back door.

730
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,778
- And, Dale...
- Yeah.

731
00:45:31,820 --> 00:45:32,988
Try not to shoot me.

732
00:45:34,366 --> 00:45:35,994
- OK, I'll try.
- All right.

733
00:45:36,036 --> 00:45:39,835
- What the fuck is taking so long?
- I don't know.

734
00:45:42,423 --> 00:45:44,970
Hey, college kids! You want some of this?

735
00:45:52,777 --> 00:45:54,029
(Gunshots)

736
00:46:06,428 --> 00:46:09,809
Ha-ha! You like that, college kids?
How's that taste?

737
00:46:09,851 --> 00:46:13,609
I got plenty more where that came from!
Bunch of freaks! (Fires nail gun)

738
00:46:18,367 --> 00:46:19,746
- (Clicking)
- Shit!

739
00:46:19,787 --> 00:46:21,415
(Screams)

740
00:46:28,137 --> 00:46:31,685
Jesus, Dale. (Pants)
Take it easy.

741
00:46:31,727 --> 00:46:32,813
Hey, hillbilly!

742
00:46:33,981 --> 00:46:37,572
You shoot at us again, and your dog's dead!

743
00:46:38,448 --> 00:46:42,373
If you kill my dog,
I swear to God, I'll get really mad!

744
00:46:42,414 --> 00:46:43,708
Then bring out the girl!

745
00:46:47,967 --> 00:46:50,639
- (Chad) I'm gonna shoot your dog!
- (Jangers whines)

746
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,225
(Dale) I'm gonna get really mad!

747
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,811
(Sobs) I'll get really mad!

748
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:59,030
(Hushed) Go home. Go!
No, you're going the wrong way, shithead!

749
00:47:02,035 --> 00:47:03,496
(Chuckles nervously)

750
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:05,625
(Tucker) Oh!

751
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:08,006
It is a beautiful day for a run, isn't it?

752
00:47:15,812 --> 00:47:17,941
(Whimpering)

753
00:47:23,828 --> 00:47:25,247
(Panting)

754
00:47:35,851 --> 00:47:37,312
(G roans)

755
00:47:51,088 --> 00:47:52,174
(Squeals)

756
00:47:58,603 --> 00:48:00,273
(Breathing heavily)

757
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:11,587
Oh, God. Please, no.

758
00:48:14,843 --> 00:48:16,805
(Creaking)

759
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:21,564
(Girl) Are we done yet?

760
00:48:21,647 --> 00:48:25,030
(Chad) I don't know, Naomi, is it covered?
We may only get one chance at this.

761
00:48:25,113 --> 00:48:27,618
All right...trap's set.

762
00:48:27,659 --> 00:48:29,288
(Tucker moans)

763
00:48:29,330 --> 00:48:32,168
- Hey...he's awake.
- (Tucker coughs)

764
00:48:35,842 --> 00:48:38,180
(Strained)
What the hell is wrong with you kids?

765
00:48:38,221 --> 00:48:40,809
What is the matter with us?

766
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:42,020
- Hold him steady.
- Yeah.

767
00:48:42,062 --> 00:48:44,066
VVait. Stop...

768
00:48:47,323 --> 00:48:49,661
I've never stood so close to pure evil before.

769
00:48:50,955 --> 00:48:52,499
(Sniffing)

770
00:48:55,253 --> 00:48:59,554
- It kind of stinks.
- It was supposed to be 24-hour protection...

771
00:48:59,638 --> 00:49:01,182
OK! Don't...

772
00:49:01,265 --> 00:49:05,983
No, look, I know you kids are having fun,
but I am not a thrill-seeker!

773
00:49:06,066 --> 00:49:08,823
It's payback time, hillbilly.

774
00:49:09,615 --> 00:49:14,332
Payback... All right, look.
Just let me go... Just let me go.

775
00:49:14,374 --> 00:49:16,253
I can get my cooler.

776
00:49:17,046 --> 00:49:19,885
Hey, I got 10 to 12 beers in there.

777
00:49:19,927 --> 00:49:23,559
They're yours.
They're on ice right now, man!

778
00:49:24,602 --> 00:49:26,815
- (Whispers) This is for |\/like!
- No!

779
00:49:26,857 --> 00:49:28,777
- (Tucker screams)
- (Girls scream)

780
00:49:30,488 --> 00:49:33,369
(Tucker cries) OW! You prick.

781
00:49:36,792 --> 00:49:38,254
(|\/loans)

782
00:49:40,592 --> 00:49:42,054
- Dale?
- Allison.

783
00:49:42,846 --> 00:49:44,725
How are you feelin'?

784
00:49:46,562 --> 00:49:49,150
- A little fuzzy.
- Yeah.

785
00:49:51,153 --> 00:49:52,364
VVha...

786
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:54,870
What happ...

787
00:49:54,912 --> 00:49:56,706
- What happened?
- Oh...

788
00:49:58,627 --> 00:49:59,796
VVe||, uh...

789
00:50:01,256 --> 00:50:03,511
(Voice breaking) I can't...
I can't really say.

790
00:50:03,552 --> 00:50:04,639
Um...

791
00:50:06,851 --> 00:50:08,312
It was so awful.

792
00:50:10,316 --> 00:50:12,779
(Sobs) Oh, my God.
I'm embarrassed. I'm sorry.

793
00:50:12,821 --> 00:50:15,576
- I can't cry in front of a girl, God damn it.
- That's OK.

794
00:50:15,618 --> 00:50:17,914
It's good to cry sometimes.

795
00:50:17,956 --> 00:50:20,001
It's OK, just...

796
00:50:20,043 --> 00:50:21,754
Just let it out. It's OK, all right?

797
00:50:21,796 --> 00:50:23,591
(Sobbing)

798
00:50:25,052 --> 00:50:27,725
There you go. It'll feel better.

799
00:50:31,774 --> 00:50:33,193
Come on, just take a deep breath.

800
00:50:35,656 --> 00:50:37,953
(Exhales deeply)

801
00:50:37,995 --> 00:50:40,291
There we go. Now...

802
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:41,585
(Dale sighs)

803
00:50:41,626 --> 00:50:43,087
Now tell me what happened.

804
00:50:44,715 --> 00:50:47,764
VVe||...it's hard to say.

805
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:49,016
Um...

806
00:50:51,062 --> 00:50:52,314
Your friends...

807
00:50:53,483 --> 00:50:56,154
Do some of your friends take medication?

808
00:50:56,989 --> 00:50:59,745
- Why?
- Because I think they forgot to take it.

809
00:51:01,749 --> 00:51:04,670
What are you talking about?
What... Where are they?

810
00:51:04,754 --> 00:51:08,720
They're out there somewhere right now
tryin' to kill my best friend...and my dog.

811
00:51:08,762 --> 00:51:11,309
- I don't understand what you're talking...
- I know.

812
00:51:11,351 --> 00:51:13,897
It doesn't make any sense.
That's what the truth is.

813
00:51:13,939 --> 00:51:17,195
It's like all your friends just
decided to go nuts all at the same time.

814
00:51:17,237 --> 00:51:21,578
The last thing I remember, I saw...
I saw Chad and...

815
00:51:21,620 --> 00:51:26,212
and then Todd was running at us, and...

816
00:51:28,049 --> 00:51:30,303
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

817
00:51:30,345 --> 00:51:32,642
At first I thought they were trying to kill you,

818
00:51:32,684 --> 00:51:37,901
and then they started killing themselves
and then they tried to kill us,

819
00:51:37,943 --> 00:51:40,156
and now they're going after my dog...

820
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:41,700
(Sobs) ..Jangers.

821
00:51:41,783 --> 00:51:43,913
(Snorts) I guess they just like killing.

822
00:51:43,955 --> 00:51:47,378
No, there must be some kind of mistake.
My friends would never hurt anyone.

823
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:49,174
- (Banging)
- Jesus, they're here!

824
00:51:49,215 --> 00:51:52,429
They're not gonna stop till they kill all of us,
I'm telling you. Hide!

825
00:51:52,471 --> 00:51:55,060
Dale, it's OK. Nobody wants to hurt you.

826
00:51:55,102 --> 00:51:57,607
- (Chad) Die, hillbilly!
- It sure sounds like someone does.

827
00:51:57,648 --> 00:52:00,069
I'm gonna go talk to them, OK?
Just stay there.

828
00:52:00,111 --> 00:52:03,241
- What? No, no.
- |t's all just a big misunderstanding.

829
00:52:03,284 --> 00:52:05,205
VVe'|| clear it right up, OK?

830
00:52:05,246 --> 00:52:08,294
Allison, don't go out there!
You don't know what it's like out there.

831
00:52:12,844 --> 00:52:13,887
Oh, my God.

832
00:52:13,929 --> 00:52:16,017
- (Flies buzzing)
- (Crows cawing)

833
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:18,856
(Gasps)

834
00:52:20,859 --> 00:52:22,655
- Ugh!
- (Hushed) Allison!

835
00:52:22,696 --> 00:52:24,241
(Breathes rapidly)

836
00:52:30,503 --> 00:52:32,131
Oh!

837
00:52:43,194 --> 00:52:45,031
Did you see them?

838
00:52:47,118 --> 00:52:49,456
- No.
- No?

839
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:55,426
That's from Tucker's shirt.

840
00:52:57,555 --> 00:52:59,602
(Dale) What is that?

841
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:01,062
(Allison) Oh, my God!

842
00:53:01,104 --> 00:53:03,859
Oh, my God!
They cut off his bowlin' fingers!

843
00:53:03,902 --> 00:53:05,529
(Gasps)

844
00:53:06,281 --> 00:53:07,950
There's a note right there.

845
00:53:20,057 --> 00:53:24,023
"Now we got your friend. Try and get him!"

846
00:53:25,985 --> 00:53:29,200
Dale, how...
how long was I out for?

847
00:53:29,909 --> 00:53:31,329
A few hours.

848
00:53:31,371 --> 00:53:33,083
I don't understand what...

849
00:53:33,124 --> 00:53:34,627
I gotta go help Tucker.

850
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,089
God damn it.

851
00:53:37,466 --> 00:53:39,762
My best friend needs me.
I'm gonna get these kids.

852
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:43,979
- Wait. We don't vvant to escalate things.
- We don't vvant to escalate things?

853
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:46,692
No. They must have thought
you were trying to harm me.

854
00:53:46,734 --> 00:53:48,737
Oh, and why would they think that?

855
00:53:51,033 --> 00:53:53,121
(Quietly) I... I don't know.

856
00:53:53,914 --> 00:53:55,293
I think you do know.

857
00:53:55,334 --> 00:53:59,884
VVe||, when we first saw you guys
back at that store...

858
00:54:01,846 --> 00:54:04,434
we just thought that you looked...

859
00:54:04,475 --> 00:54:06,397
a little creepy.

860
00:54:06,439 --> 00:54:09,612
I was nervous.
I don't know how to talk to girls, and I...

861
00:54:09,653 --> 00:54:11,615
Dale, I know that now, but we didn't then.

862
00:54:11,656 --> 00:54:13,869
You thought I looked
like some kind of freak.

863
00:54:14,704 --> 00:54:16,709
VVe misjudged you, Dale. I...

864
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:20,341
I'm really sorry.

865
00:54:20,382 --> 00:54:22,177
Don't be sorry. It's my fault.

866
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:27,061
(Sighs) I should have known that if
a guy like me talked to a girl like you,

867
00:54:27,145 --> 00:54:28,732
somebody'd end up dead.

868
00:54:29,692 --> 00:54:32,030
Dale, it's... Dale, it's not like that.

869
00:54:32,072 --> 00:54:34,576
If you do see your friends...

870
00:54:34,618 --> 00:54:37,456
tell 'em that I never wanted to hurt anybody.

871
00:54:38,626 --> 00:54:41,172
Dale, Dale, stop. VVait. No...

872
00:54:41,214 --> 00:54:42,424
Don't go there.

873
00:54:46,056 --> 00:54:47,977
Oh, shit.

874
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,438
Tucker!

875
00:54:51,901 --> 00:54:54,155
- Tucker, you cut there?
- (Voice echoes)

876
00:55:01,503 --> 00:55:02,505
Tuck!

877
00:55:21,249 --> 00:55:23,129
(Screams)

878
00:55:23,713 --> 00:55:25,884
Oh, goddamn stupid college kids.

879
00:55:30,768 --> 00:55:31,978
Tucker!

880
00:55:32,020 --> 00:55:34,651
- (Tucker, faint) Dale!
- I'm comin' for you, buddy!

881
00:55:36,112 --> 00:55:37,531
Tucker?!

882
00:55:37,573 --> 00:55:39,534
Yeah.

883
00:55:39,576 --> 00:55:41,205
Tuck! Tucker!

884
00:55:42,749 --> 00:55:44,545
- (Choked) Dale...
- Hey!

885
00:55:45,546 --> 00:55:47,008
- Tucker.
- Dale, it's a trap.

886
00:55:47,717 --> 00:55:49,596
- It's a what?
- It's a trap.

887
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:51,015
What?

888
00:55:52,059 --> 00:55:53,478
(Dale) Oh, no. Oh, no! Tuck, no!

889
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:54,980
I don't wanna die! Please!

890
00:55:55,858 --> 00:55:58,906
(Whimpers) Oh, God! Tucker!

891
00:55:58,948 --> 00:56:00,367
Dale...

892
00:56:00,409 --> 00:56:01,911
(Breathing heavily)

893
00:56:03,957 --> 00:56:06,379
Oh. Oh... Oh...

894
00:56:07,256 --> 00:56:08,591
I never thought I'd say this,

895
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:10,428
but I'm glad I'm not hung like a bear.

896
00:56:10,469 --> 00:56:13,642
- (Laughs, wheezes)
- (Laughing) That's funny.

897
00:56:14,519 --> 00:56:15,563
VVhoa...

898
00:56:17,358 --> 00:56:18,987
-Oh...
- Dale...

899
00:56:19,029 --> 00:56:22,618
that kid, he's got some serious issues.

900
00:56:22,702 --> 00:56:24,998
I know. Let's get you down from there.

901
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:27,126
- Wait!
- (\lVires Swish)

902
00:56:27,168 --> 00:56:28,547
Sorry about that.

903
00:56:28,630 --> 00:56:30,300
(Tucker) This vacation sucks.

904
00:56:31,844 --> 00:56:33,514
(Chad, hushed) Come on, let's go.

905
00:56:36,979 --> 00:56:38,356
(Owl hoots)

906
00:56:52,635 --> 00:56:54,471
(Naomi, hushed) Look at this place.

907
00:56:55,515 --> 00:56:59,940
- This is where evil lives.
- Let's just hope that Allison's still alive.

908
00:57:02,404 --> 00:57:03,656
(Hushed) Allison!

909
00:57:03,697 --> 00:57:05,242
- Allison!
- Chad?

910
00:57:06,495 --> 00:57:08,123
- Chad?
- Shh!

911
00:57:08,164 --> 00:57:09,375
What are you guys doing?

912
00:57:09,458 --> 00:57:11,295
Saving you, stupid!
Come on. Let's go.

913
00:57:11,337 --> 00:57:14,552
Why are you whispering?
There's no one else here.

914
00:57:15,804 --> 00:57:17,098
(Both) oh.

915
00:57:20,396 --> 00:57:22,316
This place is really freaky.

916
00:57:22,358 --> 00:57:25,030
What have they done to you, Allie?
Huh?

917
00:57:25,072 --> 00:57:27,243
They haven't done anything to me.

918
00:57:27,285 --> 00:57:29,539
Chad, this has all been
a huge misunderstanding.

919
00:57:29,581 --> 00:57:33,629
We have to burn this place to the ground.
Destroy it completely.

920
00:57:33,671 --> 00:57:36,093
What? No, no. Chad...

921
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:38,181
Chad! Stop.

922
00:57:39,099 --> 00:57:41,020
No, Chad, no. Chad, stop!

923
00:57:42,564 --> 00:57:46,155
You can't do this.
This is their vacation home.

924
00:57:46,197 --> 00:57:48,074
You guys have to listen to me, OK?

925
00:57:48,117 --> 00:57:52,708
Tucker and Dale did not mean
to hurt anyone. They're really nice.

926
00:57:52,750 --> 00:57:54,754
You have no idea...

927
00:57:54,796 --> 00:57:58,136
what this is all about, do you, Allison?

928
00:57:58,178 --> 00:57:59,973
- Huh?
- No.

929
00:58:01,643 --> 00:58:04,481
These freaks are evil...

930
00:58:05,358 --> 00:58:08,323
and they deserve everything
that's coming to them.

931
00:58:08,365 --> 00:58:10,535
OK, just relax, all right?

932
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:14,041
I'm just trying to explain
this is all a big misunderstanding.

933
00:58:14,083 --> 00:58:17,047
Tucker and Dale have been nothing
but gentlemen to me this entire time,

934
00:58:17,089 --> 00:58:20,346
- while you guys have been terrorising them.
- But they started this!

935
00:58:20,388 --> 00:58:23,476
By doing what? Saving my life?

936
00:58:24,562 --> 00:58:28,402
Wait a minute. I remember reading
about this in my sociology class.

937
00:58:28,485 --> 00:58:30,115
It's called Stockholm syndrome.

938
00:58:30,157 --> 00:58:33,078
When someone vvho's been kidnapped
falls in love with their kidnapper.

939
00:58:36,042 --> 00:58:37,461
You're falling in love with him?

940
00:58:37,503 --> 00:58:39,841
No. VV-VVhat?

941
00:58:39,883 --> 00:58:43,724
- Chad, the... The what? This is...
- Tell me...

942
00:58:43,765 --> 00:58:48,524
you're not falling in love
with that freak, Allison.

943
00:58:49,944 --> 00:58:51,781
How could you love him?

944
00:58:53,451 --> 00:58:55,788
Chad, please. You don't understand.

945
00:58:55,830 --> 00:58:58,669
VVe||, are you or are you not
in love with him?

946
00:58:58,711 --> 00:59:00,506
- What is the matter with you?
- Tell me!

947
00:59:01,549 --> 00:59:05,057
Hey! Let the girl go.

948
00:59:05,558 --> 00:59:06,560
(Chad) Tcha!

949
00:59:07,896 --> 00:59:11,736
- Are you OK, Allie?
- Allie? Did he just call you Allie?

950
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:15,953
VVait. Everyone just stop for a second
and |et's talk this out, OK?

951
00:59:15,994 --> 00:59:18,374
Nobody wants to hurt anyone.

952
00:59:18,415 --> 00:59:20,586
(Chuckles) You could have fooled me.

953
00:59:20,628 --> 00:59:23,174
- Fuck off, hillbilly.
- Eat shit, body perm.

954
00:59:23,217 --> 00:59:26,181
VVait! Hovv about I make some tea,

955
00:59:26,223 --> 00:59:29,103
and we all sit and talk this out?

956
00:59:29,144 --> 00:59:33,695
Oh, yeah, that sounds like a good idea.
I'll provide the finger sandwiches.

957
00:59:34,822 --> 00:59:36,451
I'm gonna go get a beer.

958
00:59:36,493 --> 00:59:40,208
OK, Chad, you...sit here, OK?

959
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:42,462
In this chair.

960
00:59:42,546 --> 00:59:44,132
(Allison) Dale, you...

961
00:59:45,092 --> 00:59:46,888
you sit in this one.

962
00:59:54,402 --> 00:59:56,908
OK, good. Now, um...

963
00:59:57,784 --> 00:59:59,329
I'm gonna get the tea.

964
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:06,091
Is that camomile tea? I can't have that.
It fucks with my asthma.

965
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:07,761
(Allison) it's Earl Grey.

966
01:00:07,802 --> 01:00:09,933
Oh, I love Earl Grey. That's great.

967
01:00:12,437 --> 01:00:17,029
Here's what we're gonna do.
I want you each to tell your side of the story,

968
01:00:17,071 --> 01:00:23,583
and as you're listening to the other person,
I want you to see yourself in their shoes.

969
01:00:23,625 --> 01:00:24,710
OK?

970
01:00:27,257 --> 01:00:28,384
OK.

971
01:00:28,467 --> 01:00:30,931
Now, it's important
that we communicate our feelings

972
01:00:31,015 --> 01:00:34,897
and understand each other's perspective
before any progress can be made.

973
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:38,946
OK.

974
01:00:39,322 --> 01:00:40,867
Chad, why don't you start?

975
01:00:42,453 --> 01:00:46,294
- Well, where should I fucking begin?
- Wherever you'd like.

976
01:00:47,212 --> 01:00:49,091
A long time ago,

977
01:00:49,133 --> 01:00:52,390
- before I was born...
- OK, maybe not that far back.

978
01:00:52,432 --> 01:00:54,143
This is important.

979
01:00:57,106 --> 01:01:00,989
You see, my parents, they were attacked
by hillbillies just like him.

980
01:01:03,328 --> 01:01:05,707
It was 20 years ago.

981
01:01:05,749 --> 01:01:07,543
The Memorial Day Massacre.

982
01:01:09,547 --> 01:01:13,012
They brutally murdered everyone.
Just for fun.

983
01:01:13,638 --> 01:01:16,645
- (Screams)
- My mother ran for her life.

984
01:01:16,686 --> 01:01:18,147
But they captured hen

985
01:01:27,082 --> 01:01:29,126
My father was helpless...

986
01:01:29,168 --> 01:01:32,842
and he didn’t even know
that she was pregnant with me yet.

987
01:01:35,305 --> 01:01:37,142
And they forced him to watch...

988
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,440
while they tortured hen

989
01:01:41,317 --> 01:01:42,403
(Sizzling)

990
01:01:43,905 --> 01:01:46,576
But my mom, she fought back...

991
01:01:46,618 --> 01:01:47,621
(I\/Iuffled scream)

992
01:01:47,705 --> 01:01:49,667
- ..and she escaped.
- (Hovvls)

993
01:01:50,836 --> 01:01:53,173
But my father wasn’t so lucky.

994
01:01:58,058 --> 01:02:00,396
His body was never found.

995
01:02:07,743 --> 01:02:09,956
By the time I was born...

996
01:02:09,998 --> 01:02:12,794
my mother was already institutionalised.

997
01:02:13,755 --> 01:02:17,094
I grew up hearing that story
from my grandmother.

998
01:02:23,941 --> 01:02:26,321
OK. Um...

999
01:02:28,282 --> 01:02:30,662
Thank you for sharing with us, Chad.

1000
01:02:35,338 --> 01:02:36,799
(Panting)

1001
01:02:38,302 --> 01:02:39,554
(Squeals)

1002
01:02:44,898 --> 01:02:47,821
- (Hushed) No, I'm not going in there!
- Hey, hey, hey.

1003
01:02:47,862 --> 01:02:51,494
Now, Chad said if they were
gone longer than 15 minutes,

1004
01:02:51,536 --> 01:02:53,331
we come in, guns blazing.

1005
01:02:53,373 --> 01:02:58,215
- But you don't even have a gun.
- Damn it, woman! Don't argue with me!

1006
01:03:07,985 --> 01:03:13,619
Are they drinking tea? Oh!
I would totally love a cup of tea right now.

1007
01:03:14,789 --> 01:03:16,083
No!

1008
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,419
No way.

1009
01:03:17,462 --> 01:03:19,631
They're fucking trapped.

1010
01:03:19,673 --> 01:03:22,094
Oh...yeah.

1011
01:03:22,136 --> 01:03:25,142
Now, come on, we gotta do something.

1012
01:03:28,608 --> 01:03:29,693
It's your turn.

1013
01:03:30,904 --> 01:03:33,325
(Clears throat) OK, well...

1014
01:03:34,577 --> 01:03:35,954
First of all...

1015
01:03:37,751 --> 01:03:41,591
I am really sorry
that your family got massacred.

1016
01:03:42,676 --> 01:03:43,929
That is awful.

1017
01:03:44,054 --> 01:03:48,438
Secondly...
I didn't have anything to do with that, OK?

1018
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:52,445
I mean, I would have been six years old
at the time, so...

1019
01:03:52,529 --> 01:03:55,785
It may not have been you,
but it was definitely your kind.

1020
01:03:55,827 --> 01:04:00,419
My kind? Now, hey, I can't even hurt a fish,
can I, Tucker? I can't even hurt fish.

1021
01:04:00,461 --> 01:04:03,800
That's right.
He can't even hurt a fish.

1022
01:04:03,843 --> 01:04:05,720
(Dale) I just can't do it!

1023
01:04:05,762 --> 01:04:09,938
OK. S-So now that you've both
expressed your side of the story,

1024
01:04:09,980 --> 01:04:12,359
how do you feel?

1025
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:15,197
I feel better. I feel...
(Breathes deeply)

1026
01:04:15,239 --> 01:04:17,410
I feel like a weight... Yeah, I feel good.

1027
01:04:18,412 --> 01:04:21,961
Great. OK.
We're really making good progress.

1028
01:04:22,003 --> 01:04:23,589
(Door slams open)

1029
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:26,010
It's show time, freaks! (Screams)

1030
01:04:26,678 --> 01:04:28,891
- (Allison) Jason! No!
- (Screams)

1031
01:04:31,312 --> 01:04:32,355
Jesus Christ!

1032
01:04:35,820 --> 01:04:38,743
Oh, shit, baby! Why didn't you duck?
Why didn't she duck?

1033
01:04:39,953 --> 01:04:41,456
Chad, st... (Gasps)

1034
01:04:42,124 --> 01:04:43,461
- Get him, Tucker!
- (Grunts)

1035
01:04:45,422 --> 01:04:46,466
Dale!

1036
01:04:49,180 --> 01:04:51,183
Go back to hell where you belong, freak!

1037
01:04:51,768 --> 01:04:53,688
- Oh, shit!
- (Dale) VVhoa!

1038
01:04:53,730 --> 01:04:55,984
- (Screaming)
- Shit! Chad, what the fuck?

1039
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,613
- Be calm. It's just the leg.
- Stop and roll.

1040
01:04:57,655 --> 01:04:59,449
- I'm on fire!
- No, don't use that.

1041
01:05:01,078 --> 01:05:02,163
Aargh!

1042
01:05:04,208 --> 01:05:05,294
Aargh!

1043
01:05:05,378 --> 01:05:06,630
Stop, drop, and roll!

1044
01:05:08,175 --> 01:05:10,053
- Get away from him!
- Stomp it out!

1045
01:05:16,232 --> 01:05:18,528
(Tucker) He's crackling like a log!

1046
01:05:18,570 --> 01:05:19,864
Oh, that stinks.

1047
01:05:22,703 --> 01:05:24,915
- Oh, shit!
- (Dale) I knew I shoulda moved that.

1048
01:05:25,959 --> 01:05:27,296
(Breathing rapidly)

1049
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,469
(Dale) Allie, run!
(Tucker) Run!

1050
01:05:31,511 --> 01:05:32,555
Come on, let's go!

1051
01:05:33,765 --> 01:05:35,769
- (Grunts)
- Help me!

1052
01:05:35,811 --> 01:05:37,858
Get off of me, you nasty bitch!

1053
01:05:39,694 --> 01:05:41,113
(Screaming)

1054
01:05:41,155 --> 01:05:43,451
- (Allison whimpers)
- (Tucker and Dale groan)

1055
01:05:48,209 --> 01:05:49,672
My cabin.

1056
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:52,177
Your cabin.

1057
01:05:53,220 --> 01:05:54,765
I'm a terrible therapist.

1058
01:05:54,848 --> 01:05:57,937
What? No, that's not true.
Don't say that.

1059
01:05:57,979 --> 01:06:00,360
I thought you did a great job in there.

1060
01:06:00,401 --> 01:06:02,529
- Really?
- Yeah, really.

1061
01:06:03,782 --> 01:06:06,579
(Dale) I think we were
on the verge of a breakthrough.

1062
01:06:07,998 --> 01:06:09,709
Thanks, Dale. That's really sweet.

1063
01:06:09,751 --> 01:06:11,923
- Uh, guys?
- Yeah.

1064
01:06:12,883 --> 01:06:15,806
- (Grunts)
- (Blade scrapes)

1065
01:06:15,847 --> 01:06:18,142
I think we should go
to the pickup truck right now.

1066
01:06:18,185 --> 01:06:19,980
VVait. Maybe we should help him.

1067
01:06:22,068 --> 01:06:23,279
(Roars)

1068
01:06:23,320 --> 01:06:25,324
- Argh!
- Never mind. Let's just go.

1069
01:06:25,366 --> 01:06:27,244
(Tucker) Get to the truck!

1070
01:06:27,286 --> 01:06:29,581
(Dale) Tucker! Tucker!

1071
01:06:29,623 --> 01:06:31,251
(Grunting)

1072
01:06:31,335 --> 01:06:33,047
(Tucker) He's coming!

1073
01:06:33,381 --> 01:06:37,639
- OK, come on, truck. Come on, truck.
- Come on, Dale. Go, go!

1074
01:06:37,681 --> 01:06:40,269
- Do not flood it.
- Do you wanna drive?!

1075
01:06:40,311 --> 01:06:42,273
- Guys, just go!
- Be careful with this.

1076
01:06:42,315 --> 01:06:44,445
This is the only thing I got left.

1077
01:06:44,486 --> 01:06:45,697
(Engine starts)

1078
01:06:46,197 --> 01:06:47,241
Go.

1079
01:06:51,916 --> 01:06:55,716
(Laughs) Oh!
Crazy college kid can't catch us now!

1080
01:06:55,758 --> 01:06:57,302
- (Allison) Dale, look out!
- Huh?

1081
01:07:12,581 --> 01:07:14,710
Jangers, not now, boy.

1082
01:07:14,794 --> 01:07:17,759
(Chuckles) Jangers, hey!

1083
01:07:19,595 --> 01:07:21,349
VVhoa. Jangers!

1084
01:07:22,893 --> 01:07:24,062
Allie.

1085
01:07:24,939 --> 01:07:26,483
Allison!

1086
01:07:27,736 --> 01:07:29,657
Jangers... Allison!

1087
01:07:30,616 --> 01:07:31,868
She's gone.

1088
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:34,582
(Groans) What the hell... Tucker?

1089
01:07:37,421 --> 01:07:41,137
(Pants) Tucker, what happened?
Tucker, what hap...

1090
01:07:42,347 --> 01:07:44,309
- He took her.
- (Sighs)

1091
01:07:44,351 --> 01:07:46,230
I tried to stop him.

1092
01:07:46,272 --> 01:07:49,779
- (Coughs)
- VVhoa, take it easy.

1093
01:07:49,821 --> 01:07:51,115
I tell you something, Dale.

1094
01:07:51,198 --> 01:07:53,745
It's gonna be a long time
before I take a vacation again.

1095
01:07:53,828 --> 01:07:57,710
Oh, shit. Tucker, this is all my fault.

1096
01:07:59,129 --> 01:08:00,550
- Look at you.
- Nah.

1097
01:08:00,592 --> 01:08:04,349
I never should have talked to Allison.
You were right.

1098
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:06,519
People like me and people like her
just don't mix.

1099
01:08:06,561 --> 01:08:08,731
- That's not true.
- It is true!

1100
01:08:08,774 --> 01:08:11,529
I never should have even
came out here with you.

1101
01:08:11,571 --> 01:08:13,742
Listen to me. (Whimpers)

1102
01:08:14,659 --> 01:08:16,455
(|\/loans)

1103
01:08:16,497 --> 01:08:18,709
Do you remember when we was kids...

1104
01:08:19,878 --> 01:08:22,175
and we used to go catch frogs
down at that creek?

1105
01:08:22,217 --> 01:08:24,220
Yeah. Yeah, I guess I do.

1106
01:08:25,473 --> 01:08:29,647
Remember how we used to compete
to see who could catch more?

1107
01:08:29,688 --> 01:08:33,028
Yeah, but I don't think now's
the time to talk about it, Tucker.

1108
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:37,830
And I used to tell you that I let you catch
more than me because I felt sorry for you.

1109
01:08:37,871 --> 01:08:40,793
I remember you used
to let me lick 'em all, too.

1110
01:08:40,835 --> 01:08:42,964
That always made me feel kinda funny.

1111
01:08:43,005 --> 01:08:45,344
Yeah. VVe||, the thing is...

1112
01:08:46,763 --> 01:08:48,684
I didn't let you catch more.

1113
01:08:49,644 --> 01:08:52,065
You caught 'em on your own.
You was quicker than I was.

1114
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:54,153
- Come on, Tucker.
- It's true.

1115
01:08:54,194 --> 01:08:59,538
What |'m trying to tell you...
is that you're better than you think you are.

1116
01:09:00,665 --> 01:09:03,044
Listen to me. That girl sees it.

1117
01:09:04,088 --> 01:09:07,763
I've seen the way that the two of you
look at each other.

1118
01:09:10,350 --> 01:09:11,979
You know, I think that she...

1119
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:14,984
really sees you for who you are.

1120
01:09:16,571 --> 01:09:18,867
Who knows?
Maybe after this is all done...

1121
01:09:20,077 --> 01:09:21,372
you two can...

1122
01:09:22,332 --> 01:09:24,586
(Grunts) _.date or something.

1123
01:09:24,628 --> 01:09:28,720
- I doubt it.
- Dude, that's what I'm talking about.

1124
01:09:28,762 --> 01:09:30,556
I don't want any more negativity.

1125
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:33,437
- OK.
- Stop it!

1126
01:09:33,479 --> 01:09:35,858
- OK.
- You are a good man.

1127
01:09:36,819 --> 01:09:38,154
You're smart...

1128
01:09:39,199 --> 01:09:40,701
and you're strong...

1129
01:09:41,745 --> 01:09:44,083
and you're not as ugly as you think you are.

1130
01:09:44,125 --> 01:09:48,298
Thank you, Tucker.
That means a lot comin' from you.

1131
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:51,055
- (Sighs) Life is short.
- I know.

1132
01:09:52,766 --> 01:09:56,231
You gotta go after what you want.
Go after her, Dale.

1133
01:09:56,314 --> 01:09:59,069
She needs you now more than ever,

1134
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:03,537
especially cos she's always falling down
and hitting her head, knocking herself out.

1135
01:10:03,579 --> 01:10:07,502
- But I don't even know where he took her.
- Jangers'|| know.

1136
01:10:10,175 --> 01:10:14,016
- OK, but I'm not leaving you here.
- No, no, no.

1137
01:10:14,057 --> 01:10:16,729
I'll be fine. Go.

1138
01:10:16,770 --> 01:10:18,441
(Breathes deeply)

1139
01:10:22,490 --> 01:10:25,204
- Friends forever?
- Best friends forever.

1140
01:10:27,666 --> 01:10:28,835
- (Crunching)
- Oh, Jesus!

1141
01:10:28,919 --> 01:10:30,547
- God! Fuck...
- I'm sorry.

1142
01:10:30,589 --> 01:10:32,217
OK.

1143
01:10:32,258 --> 01:10:33,552
(G roans)

1144
01:10:34,805 --> 01:10:36,434
(Strained) That hurt very much!

1145
01:10:36,518 --> 01:10:38,772
I could tell. Just breathe in.

1146
01:10:38,813 --> 01:10:40,274
Out through your mouth.

1147
01:10:40,316 --> 01:10:42,237
Go get her. Go get her.

1148
01:10:43,906 --> 01:10:45,744
- Do me a favour.
- Anything.

1149
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:48,874
Kick the shit out of that little
college dickhead for me, would you?

1150
01:10:48,916 --> 01:10:52,506
I'm gonna shove my boot down
his fuckin' throat. You stay here, OK?

1151
01:10:52,548 --> 01:10:54,051
Come on, Jangers, let's go.

1152
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:57,516
(Barking)

1153
01:11:15,049 --> 01:11:17,220
Good boy, Jangers. Good boy.

1154
01:11:17,304 --> 01:11:20,936
OK. (Pants)
You gotta let me take it from here, OK, pup?

1155
01:11:20,978 --> 01:11:24,109
Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doing.

1156
01:11:24,151 --> 01:11:26,155
More or less. OK, stay.

1157
01:11:31,165 --> 01:11:32,792
What is the matter with you?

1158
01:11:32,834 --> 01:11:35,255
(Laughing) What is the matter with me?

1159
01:11:35,297 --> 01:11:39,764
Do you have any idea what
I've been through trying to save you?

1160
01:11:39,805 --> 01:11:40,850
No.

1161
01:11:41,810 --> 01:11:43,813
You've gone hillbilly on me, Allison.

1162
01:11:45,066 --> 01:11:47,153
Now, I'm willing to forgive you...

1163
01:11:47,195 --> 01:11:49,241
but you're gonna have to beg.

1164
01:11:50,243 --> 01:11:51,329
Chad...

1165
01:11:53,249 --> 01:11:54,459
(Whimpers)

1166
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:55,836
Oh!

1167
01:11:56,838 --> 01:11:59,594
That was just not a very nice apology kiss.

1168
01:11:59,636 --> 01:12:02,308
(Chuckles)
You see, we're making up, Allie,

1169
01:12:02,350 --> 01:12:04,396
so you have to be
more passionate than that!

1170
01:12:04,437 --> 01:12:06,023
- Chad, please...
- That's a start.

1171
01:12:06,065 --> 01:12:07,651
- Please...
- You're getting warmer.

1172
01:12:07,693 --> 01:12:09,029
Just stop, please!

1173
01:12:09,071 --> 01:12:11,575
No. I'm not gonna stop.

1174
01:12:11,617 --> 01:12:13,663
I've only just begun.

1175
01:12:14,498 --> 01:12:15,792
(Whimpers)

1176
01:12:17,044 --> 01:12:18,798
(Banging)

1177
01:12:37,585 --> 01:12:41,175
You want a killer hillbilly?
I'll show you a killer hillbilly.

1178
01:13:03,467 --> 01:13:05,221
Allie! Allie! Hey, it's just me. Hey...

1179
01:13:05,262 --> 01:13:06,682
- (whispers) It's OK.
- Dale?

1180
01:13:06,723 --> 01:13:08,436
- Yeah.
- What are you wearing?

1181
01:13:08,478 --> 01:13:11,817
What? Oh, I thought it might look
kind of intimidating. Does it?

1182
01:13:12,652 --> 01:13:14,698
- Yeah.
- Sweet.

1183
01:13:16,158 --> 01:13:19,165
Dale, you wanna...
you wanna help me here?

1184
01:13:19,249 --> 01:13:20,960
Oh, yeah. Hang on, I'm comin'.

1185
01:13:22,295 --> 01:13:23,423
Hang on.

1186
01:13:25,927 --> 01:13:29,225
- OK, what do we got here?
- Thank you for coming for me.

1187
01:13:29,267 --> 01:13:32,524
It's no big deal.
I was headed over this way anymfay, so...

1188
01:13:37,116 --> 01:13:38,744
(Microphone whistles)

1189
01:13:40,079 --> 01:13:41,917
(Chad over PA) How sweet.

1190
01:13:41,959 --> 01:13:46,801
The dim-witted hillbilly
is trying to save the girl of his dreams.

1191
01:13:46,843 --> 01:13:48,179
What kind of knot is this?

1192
01:13:48,220 --> 01:13:50,975
You think you're gonna win,
but you're wrong.

1193
01:13:51,936 --> 01:13:54,691
It’s time to say goodbye to the girl.

1194
01:13:54,775 --> 01:13:56,904
You shouldn't have betrayed me, Allison.

1195
01:13:56,987 --> 01:13:58,366
(Microphone whistles)

1196
01:14:01,371 --> 01:14:03,626
No. Oh, jeez. No, no!

1197
01:14:03,667 --> 01:14:05,295
- Oh, Dale! Dale!
- OK. OK.

1198
01:14:05,337 --> 01:14:07,341
(Allison whimpers)

1199
01:14:09,261 --> 01:14:10,555
- OK, OK.
- Dale!

1200
01:14:10,597 --> 01:14:13,560
Hold on! OK, rabbit comes out the tree,
rabbit goes around the tree...

1201
01:14:13,602 --> 01:14:15,649
- Dale, come on!
- OK! Jesus, OK!

1202
01:14:16,609 --> 01:14:18,320
(Chainsaw buzzes)

1203
01:14:25,501 --> 01:14:27,380
Oh, that is really too bad.

1204
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:31,972
Are you OK, huh?
Because I didn't mean to...

1205
01:14:32,389 --> 01:14:33,391
(Allison screams)

1206
01:14:37,190 --> 01:14:38,192
- Dale!
- (Roars)

1207
01:14:40,780 --> 01:14:42,283
- (Crunch)
- (Screams)

1208
01:14:57,688 --> 01:15:00,026
- Dale!
- (Groaning)

1209
01:15:05,411 --> 01:15:06,830
Dale!

1210
01:15:18,812 --> 01:15:21,067
It's time for you to feel my pain.

1211
01:15:22,277 --> 01:15:23,738
Bring it, frat bitch.

1212
01:15:46,825 --> 01:15:50,874
- (Allison) Dale, over here!
- Come on! Let's get outta here.

1213
01:15:53,212 --> 01:15:56,135
Come on. Come on. Here! Come on!

1214
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:59,432
Go! Go, get up there.
Go. Come on. Quick, quick, quick.

1215
01:16:01,644 --> 01:16:03,566
- Dale, here!
- Oh, yeah, give me that.

1216
01:16:04,943 --> 01:16:06,279
Put a couple boxes on there.

1217
01:16:06,321 --> 01:16:09,911
Oh, Jesus H Christ!
That kid is tough as nails.

1218
01:16:09,952 --> 01:16:11,998
- Are you OK?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1219
01:16:12,040 --> 01:16:15,589
- OK. OK. (Pants)
- Looks like no one's been here for a while.

1220
01:16:15,631 --> 01:16:18,594
Yeah. What we need to find
is some kind of weapon,

1221
01:16:18,636 --> 01:16:22,059
something preferably big and sharp
so I can stab him!

1222
01:16:22,100 --> 01:16:23,521
Nah! Shit...

1223
01:16:23,562 --> 01:16:26,819
Oh, hey! This might work, huh?

1224
01:16:26,860 --> 01:16:27,904
Or not.

1225
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:37,589
Oh, my God. Dale?

1226
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:39,802
- What?
- Come here and look at this.

1227
01:16:39,885 --> 01:16:41,764
(Breathing heavily)

1228
01:16:43,016 --> 01:16:44,060
Look.

1229
01:16:44,102 --> 01:16:46,189
- VVhat?
- Something look familiar?

1230
01:16:46,231 --> 01:16:49,989
- Hey, ain't that that dead Sheriff right there?
- No, that picture.

1231
01:16:50,030 --> 01:16:53,328
- Look at the guy in the middle.
- Oh, yeah.

1232
01:16:53,370 --> 01:16:56,542
He looks just like that
Kentucky fried college kid down there.

1233
01:16:56,584 --> 01:16:58,379
- Yeah.
- That's funny.

1234
01:16:58,421 --> 01:17:03,139
And it says here, "The single survivor
leads police to the Memorial Day Killer.

1235
01:17:03,180 --> 01:17:06,896
"The survivor is reported
to have been tortured and raped.

1236
01:17:06,937 --> 01:17:09,651
"She's now undergoing
psychiatric evaluation."

1237
01:17:11,780 --> 01:17:14,870
Think about it. He said his mother
was captured and his father...

1238
01:17:14,912 --> 01:17:17,082
His father's body was never found.

1239
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:20,590
(Allison) I think we've just found him.

1240
01:17:20,673 --> 01:17:22,801
(Dale) Holy S-H-I-T.

1241
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,889
- (Chainsaw buzzes)
- (Dale) Jesus Christ!

1242
01:17:24,931 --> 01:17:26,517
Chad!

1243
01:17:28,729 --> 01:17:30,816
- Time to die, freak!
- (Dale) Wait!

1244
01:17:30,858 --> 01:17:32,195
Just wait! VVait, wait!

1245
01:17:32,237 --> 01:17:33,949
VVait, Chad! VVait!

1246
01:17:34,658 --> 01:17:36,328
- You're a hillbilly, too!
- Shut up!

1247
01:17:36,370 --> 01:17:37,997
- No! Look!
- (Chainsaw idles)

1248
01:17:38,039 --> 01:17:40,085
That's your real father.
Right there!

1249
01:17:41,295 --> 01:17:43,007
No. No!

1250
01:17:43,049 --> 01:17:45,095
It's true, Chad. You're half hillbilly.

1251
01:17:47,850 --> 01:17:49,395
It can't be.

1252
01:17:52,525 --> 01:17:54,572
They lied to me!

1253
01:17:56,074 --> 01:17:58,120
How could they?

1254
01:17:58,161 --> 01:18:00,082
Maybe they didn't vvant you
to know the truth.

1255
01:18:00,165 --> 01:18:01,960
There is no truth!

1256
01:18:02,628 --> 01:18:05,259
(Growls) Everything is a lie!

1257
01:18:09,057 --> 01:18:11,478
- What did you do?
- Anthemis nobilis.

1258
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,816
- What?
- It's the ingredient in camomile tea

1259
01:18:13,858 --> 01:18:18,326
that causes an anaphylactic reaction
in rare cases where people are allergic to it.

1260
01:18:18,367 --> 01:18:20,288
Like I said, I remember weird stuff.

1261
01:18:20,330 --> 01:18:23,335
But he'll be OK,
as long as we get him his inhaler.

1262
01:18:23,376 --> 01:18:24,796
(Screams)

1263
01:18:30,641 --> 01:18:32,227
Or not. (Sighs)

1264
01:18:40,535 --> 01:18:42,080
(Indistinct chatter)

1265
01:18:42,163 --> 01:18:44,793
(Cameraman) OK, here we go.
And, you ready?

1266
01:18:44,834 --> 01:18:48,091
- Uh, yeah, wait. My teeth. Do I got any...
- Teeth are clear.

1267
01:18:48,132 --> 01:18:50,680
- Clear? OK, just give me a second.
- And we're rolling.

1268
01:18:54,186 --> 01:18:58,403
(Sighs) The chaos and confusion
of what transpired here last night

1269
01:18:58,444 --> 01:19:00,156
is still being unravelled.

1270
01:19:00,198 --> 01:19:02,912
What appears to be a tragic mass suicide

1271
01:19:02,954 --> 01:19:06,419
involving a group of
mentally unstable college kids

1272
01:19:06,460 --> 01:19:11,595
may in fact be the work of a lone deranged
killer whose body has yet to be found.

1273
01:19:11,637 --> 01:19:15,477
- The killings happened on the ....
- (Dale) Knock knock. Hey!

1274
01:19:17,023 --> 01:19:20,403
- Hey, buddy. How you feeling?
- I'm feeling...

1275
01:19:21,113 --> 01:19:22,867
high on prescription medication.

1276
01:19:22,950 --> 01:19:25,121
- Yeah, looks like it.
- (Chuckles)

1277
01:19:25,831 --> 01:19:27,667
They found my fingers.

1278
01:19:28,627 --> 01:19:30,047
Check it out.

1279
01:19:30,088 --> 01:19:32,134
- Yeah.
- I got to tell you...

1280
01:19:33,471 --> 01:19:35,683
I don't remember that one looking that way.

1281
01:19:35,725 --> 01:19:37,937
Does that look funny to you?

1282
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:39,357
No. No, not really.

1283
01:19:40,860 --> 01:19:43,324
That looks natural. It's good.

1284
01:19:43,366 --> 01:19:45,285
By the way, I brought you something.

1285
01:19:45,327 --> 01:19:47,414
- Shut your eyes, OK?
- All right.

1286
01:19:47,456 --> 01:19:49,042
OK, open them.

1287
01:19:50,044 --> 01:19:51,714
Oh...

1288
01:19:51,756 --> 01:19:53,968
- Oh, buddy.
- That's a PBR, buddy.

1289
01:19:54,010 --> 01:19:57,100
That...
that's a thing of beauty.

1290
01:19:57,183 --> 01:19:58,812
- It's cold, too, should be.
- Oh, oh...

1291
01:19:58,853 --> 01:20:00,231
Look what else I got you.

1292
01:20:00,314 --> 01:20:03,069
A bendy straw,
your favourite sipping utensil.

1293
01:20:03,152 --> 01:20:05,156
- - There you go.

1294
01:20:05,198 --> 01:20:07,537
Mmm. |\/Im!

1295
01:20:07,578 --> 01:20:10,751
Don't choke. I'm gonna let you rest.
You enjoy that, OK?

1296
01:20:10,793 --> 01:20:13,673
Drink the whole thing.
When I come back, |'m gonna have more.

1297
01:20:13,715 --> 01:20:15,050
- Dale?
- Yeah?

1298
01:20:15,802 --> 01:20:17,264
Did you ask her?

1299
01:20:18,725 --> 01:20:22,733
- Ask her what?
- Did you ask her out, for God's sake?

1300
01:20:22,774 --> 01:20:25,529
Oh.VVe||...

1301
01:20:25,571 --> 01:20:26,990
(Sighs)

1302
01:20:27,031 --> 01:20:30,622
I was gonna, but then
I never actually got the chance, so...

1303
01:20:30,664 --> 01:20:31,708
Dale!

1304
01:20:31,750 --> 01:20:34,881
(Sighs) You are hopeless,
you know that? You're hopeless.

1305
01:20:34,922 --> 01:20:39,140
Yeah. You're probably right about that.

1306
01:20:40,099 --> 01:20:41,351
Except for...

1307
01:20:41,435 --> 01:20:45,735
she kinda mentioned to me
that she's a pretty darn good bowler, so...

1308
01:20:45,777 --> 01:20:46,820
we're goin' bowling.

1309
01:20:49,284 --> 01:20:51,914
- You little dickhead.
- I'm outta here.

1310
01:20:51,955 --> 01:20:55,755
(Laughing) OW.

1311
01:20:56,756 --> 01:20:58,718
VVhoo! Yes.

1312
01:20:58,760 --> 01:21:03,228
- Dale Dobson, you are one lucky man.
- I guess it's just beginner's luck. (Giggles)

1313
01:21:03,269 --> 01:21:06,692
That girl has got an amazing set...
of bowling fingers.

1314
01:21:06,734 --> 01:21:10,032
I know.
Listen, let me tell you something, OK?

1315
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:12,913
Life is short, BJ.
You have to go after what you want,

1316
01:21:12,955 --> 01:21:15,793
because it sure as heck fire
ain't gonna just fall right into your lap.

1317
01:21:15,835 --> 01:21:18,382
- You know somethin'? You're right.
- I know.

1318
01:21:18,465 --> 01:21:21,303
- I'm gonna go talk to her.
- OK. Right, now, listen to me, though.

1319
01:21:21,387 --> 01:21:23,934
Don't be nervous, and just be yourself, OK?

1320
01:21:24,017 --> 01:21:25,228
Yeah.

1321
01:21:25,270 --> 01:21:27,190
You got 'er. Go, buddy.

1322
01:21:28,860 --> 01:21:29,903
Hey.

1323
01:21:29,945 --> 01:21:32,659
- I'm pretty good at this, aren't I?
- You are. That was great.

1324
01:21:32,701 --> 01:21:37,168
Listen, Allie, I hope you don't think
this is too stupid or whatever,

1325
01:21:37,209 --> 01:21:39,297
but I got you a little something.

1326
01:21:40,340 --> 01:21:42,845
Dale, that's so sweet.
You didn't have to do that.

1327
01:21:42,887 --> 01:21:44,182
I know. I wanted to.

1328
01:21:45,267 --> 01:21:47,062
(Laughing) Oh, my gosh.

1329
01:21:47,104 --> 01:21:50,986
- You know what that is?
- Yes, it's a... it's a helmet.

1330
01:21:51,028 --> 01:21:52,614
It's a pink helmet.

1331
01:21:52,655 --> 01:21:56,330
I think, you know, it might just be better if
you wear that every day from now on, so...

1332
01:21:56,414 --> 01:21:58,375
- OK, thank you.
- You're welcome.

1333
01:21:58,417 --> 01:21:59,878
|t's perfect.

1334
01:22:01,548 --> 01:22:03,301
So, listen, Dale, I'm, uh...

1335
01:22:03,384 --> 01:22:06,475
I'm really sorry about
everything that happened.

1336
01:22:06,517 --> 01:22:09,104
What do you mean?
For what? I had a great time.

1337
01:22:09,146 --> 01:22:13,196
I mean, except for all the people dying, when
they were bleeding on us and everything.

1338
01:22:13,238 --> 01:22:16,284
That wasn't so much fun,
but...you know...

1339
01:22:17,287 --> 01:22:19,416
I enjoyed every minute
I got to spend with you.

1340
01:22:19,458 --> 01:22:22,171
- Dale...
- You know what? Let me just say this,

1341
01:22:22,213 --> 01:22:26,805
cos I don't know if we're ever gonna get
to spend this kind of time together again,

1342
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:28,476
and I want to let you know that I...

1343
01:22:30,437 --> 01:22:32,066
I feel the same way.

1344
01:22:34,319 --> 01:22:36,365
- Really?
- Really.

1345
01:22:37,117 --> 01:22:38,411
(Woman screams)

1346
01:22:38,494 --> 01:22:40,123
- (Smack)
- BJ!

1347
01:22:41,793 --> 01:22:44,464
Oh, my God, should we go help her?

1348
01:22:44,506 --> 01:22:45,592
Hell, no.

1349
01:22:50,935 --> 01:22:51,979
Whatever.
