about using this one for the test.

Mom's brakes are very sticky--

Sure.

Yeah, you're great.

Just a saying.

Don't worry.
I won't be wearing bells.

Yeah.

Have you thought anymore
about about what we discussed?

74
00:05:32,193 --> 00:05:35,695
"Thought any more,"
meaning reconsidered?

00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,763
No.

76
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:39,199

Hey, I don't love
this situation, all right,

82
00:05:51,045 --> 00:05:53,914
that you put me in.

83
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:57,517
[sighs] However, let's just stick
with what makes sense here.

84
00:05:57,552 --> 00:06:00,287
You took the seed money.
You went gambling.

85
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:03,123
You invested it in the car wash
that you helped run for four years.

86
00:06:03,157 --> 00:06:04,758
You hired your wife
as a bookkeeper.

87
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:07,661
Because guess what?
She's actually a bookkeeper.

88
00:06:07,695 --> 00:06:11,031
Now, that is a story an auditor can
believe, so what am I missing?

89
00:06:11,065 --> 00:06:14,434
You're missing that you should just
take this money that I give you

90
00:06:14,468 --> 00:06:16,403
and not look too closely at it,

91
00:06:16,437 --> 00:06:21,041
so if, God forbid,
I get caught,

92
00:06:21,075 --> 00:06:23,977
you maintain
plausible deniability.

93
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:26,546
Okay, my estranged husband

94
00:06:26,581 --> 00:06:27,948
who, when he was working,

95
00:06:27,982 --> 00:06:30,150
made $43,000 a year,

96
00:06:30,184 --> 00:06:31,985
starts shoveling money at me,

97
00:06:32,019 --> 00:06:33,587
and when the police come,
I'm supposed to say,

98
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:36,990
"Gee, I never thought about it, Officers.
Made sense to me."

99
00:06:37,024 --> 00:06:41,928
Really? That, in your mind,
is plausible deniability?

100
00:06:41,963 --> 00:06:43,530
I'll tell you what, Walt.

101
00:06:43,564 --> 00:06:46,866
I'd rather have them think
I'm Bonnie what's-her-name

102

than some complete idiot.

103
00:06:49,904 --> 00:06:54,274
So you're promoting
caution here.

[sighs]

105
00:06:55,543 --> 00:06:59,946
And you want
a believable story.

00:06:59,981 --> 00:07:02,249
That, it seems to me,

107
00:07:02,283 --> 00:07:03,950
is the safest way
to make the best

yes.

Ah.

110
00:07:09,924 --> 00:07:14,928
But I'm noting a little hole
in your plot, though.

111
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,064
Why would
your estranged husband

112
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:19,666
be doing all this for you?

113
00:07:21,502 --> 00:07:24,971
Because he loves his family

114
00:07:25,006 --> 00:07:27,040
and desperately wants
a reconciliation,

115
00:07:27,074 --> 00:07:31,111
though it may be hopeless
and futile.

116
00:07:31,145 --> 00:07:34,347
Then again, he'd try anything.

117
00:07:38,619 --> 00:07:40,487
I'm just not buying it.

118
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:42,188
No, I think it would be better

119
00:07:42,223 --> 00:07:44,991
if the husband were
no longer estranged.

120
00:07:45,026 --> 00:07:46,426
Mmm.

121
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:50,063
You know, maybe if he were back
sleeping in his own bed.

122
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:52,532
Wow.

123
00:07:52,566 --> 00:07:54,501
It's suddenly a fantasy story.

124
00:07:59,507 --> 00:08:02,809
I am at least going to be
a part of this household.

125
00:08:02,843 --> 00:08:04,811
Dinner with the family
every night of the week.

126
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:07,013
Not every night, no.

127
00:08:08,482 --> 00:08:10,417
Six nights a week.
You'll get one night off.

128
00:08:10,451 --> 00:08:12,786
Dinner two nights,
not weekends,

129
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,888
with 24-hours' notice.

130
00:08:14,922 --> 00:08:16,956
Five nights a week
with no notice.

131
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:19,292
Three, six-hours' notice.

132
00:08:19,327 --> 00:08:21,628
Five nights a week

F--

134
00:08:22,697 --> 00:08:25,098
Don't push it.

135
00:08:27,234 --> 00:08:28,802
And I want my own key
to the house.

136
00:08:28,836 --> 00:08:29,869
No.

137
00:08:29,904 --> 00:08:32,138
For emergencies
and appearances, yes.

138
00:08:32,173 --> 00:08:34,240
I am going to babysit
my own daughter.

139
00:08:34,275 --> 00:08:36,209
I'm going to help my son
with his homework.

140
00:08:36,243 --> 00:08:38,378
I am going to be
a part of this family,

141
00:08:38,412 --> 00:08:41,681
and that is how we'll sell
your little fiction.

142
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,676
How about we stop somewhere
afterward and get a beer?

143
00:09:15,216 --> 00:09:20,987
Uh, no. Thanks, though.
Maybe some other time.

144
00:09:21,021 --> 00:09:24,891
No, seriously.
Get a beer with me.

145
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,514
What?

146
00:09:56,624 --> 00:09:58,925
What the hell are you doing?

147
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:01,694
That's ours, right?

148
00:10:01,729 --> 00:10:03,963
Look at it and tell me
if that's ours.

149
00:10:10,838 --> 00:10:13,740
Yes, it's ours.
Now put it away.

150
00:10:13,774 --> 00:10:17,444
What the hell is wrong
with you?

151
00:10:17,478 --> 00:10:19,746
Where did you get that?
Did you take it from the lab?

152
00:10:21,148 --> 00:10:24,050
I bought it from the two guys
who killed Combo.

153
00:10:25,119 --> 00:10:27,720
They had Combo shot down
in the street,

154
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:29,622
and now it's our product

155
00:10:29,657 --> 00:10:31,391
they're selling.

156
00:10:32,593 --> 00:10:35,895
Which means they work
for our guy. Right?

157
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,497
What is that?
That's hearsay.

158
00:10:37,531 --> 00:10:38,832
Do you have any proof?

159
00:10:38,866 --> 00:10:44,137
I heard it from the sister
of the kid who shot him.

160
00:10:44,171 --> 00:10:47,607
Hear how I just said "kid"?

161
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:49,175
This kid--

162
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:51,277
he's 11 years old--

163
00:10:51,312 --> 00:10:54,380
shot Combo on orders.

164
00:10:54,415 --> 00:10:58,184
These two scumbags,
they got him dealing.

165
00:10:58,219 --> 00:11:00,186
They got him--

166
00:11:00,221 --> 00:11:02,121
And you know he's not
the first.

167
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:05,592
They use kids 'cause,
hey, why not?

168
00:11:05,626 --> 00:11:08,061
Easy to control, easy to fool.

169
00:11:08,095 --> 00:11:10,463
All they get is juvie
if they ever get caught.

170
00:11:10,498 --> 00:11:13,166
Hearts and minds, right?

171
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,369
Get them young,
and they're yours forever.

172
00:11:17,805 --> 00:11:20,006
These guys killed Combo.

173
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,475
They used this little kid

174
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:24,477
like some puppet.

175
00:11:24,512 --> 00:11:28,982
They used him
to shoot my friend.

176
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:37,690
So why are you telling me this?

177
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:43,563
I need your help.

178
00:11:45,332 --> 00:11:46,666
How?

179
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,700
I need ricin.

180
00:11:47,735 --> 00:11:49,269
Oh, my God.

181
00:11:51,005 --> 00:11:52,605
Oh, God.

182
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,140
These two-- Hey.

183
00:11:54,174 --> 00:11:55,508
No.
Hey.

184
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:57,610
They got to go.
All right?

185
00:11:57,645 --> 00:11:59,612
I've got the entire
thing figured out-- No.

186
00:11:59,647 --> 00:12:01,114
...a delivery method,
everything.

187
00:12:01,148 --> 00:12:04,651
All I need from you
is the poison, that's all.

188
00:12:04,685 --> 00:12:07,287
No--
L-Look,

189
00:12:07,321 --> 00:12:08,755
otherwise,
you don't have to--

190
00:12:08,789 --> 00:12:10,356
No-- ...
you don't have to lift a finger.

191
00:12:10,391 --> 00:12:12,325
Listen, you don't even know
what you're talking about.

192
00:12:12,359 --> 00:12:15,328
This is not even-- Look, you
don't get how right this is?

193
00:12:15,362 --> 00:12:19,999
Huh? You don't get how the whole
entire world would be better off--

194
00:12:20,034 --> 00:12:21,534
No, we're not even talking
about this.

195
00:12:21,569 --> 00:12:25,572
I know a woman who buys from the
these two once or twice a week.

196
00:12:25,606 --> 00:12:27,140
All right?
She brings them hamburgers

197
00:12:27,174 --> 00:12:29,475
'cause they sit in their car
all day, and they get hungry,

198
00:12:29,510 --> 00:12:30,743
so she brings them food,

199
00:12:30,778 --> 00:12:32,879
and they knock a few bucks
off her price.

200
00:12:32,913 --> 00:12:35,748
There's your delivery system
right there.

201
00:12:35,783 --> 00:12:37,250
I can be a mile away.

202
00:12:37,284 --> 00:12:41,020
Jesus. A meth-head
you're trusting to do this?

203
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:44,357
You know what? That meth-head
stood up to your brother-in-law.

204
00:12:44,391 --> 00:12:46,659
All right?
He questioned her for five hours.

205
00:12:46,694 --> 00:12:48,561
She didn't give it up.

206
00:12:48,596 --> 00:12:49,729
You know how it is you know?

207
00:12:49,763 --> 00:12:52,031
Because you're not
in prison right now.

208
00:12:52,066 --> 00:12:54,701
Yeah, well, I know I would be
in prison after this.

209
00:12:54,735 --> 00:12:58,171
Prison or worse, and I'd
be right alongside you.

210
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:01,107
No-- Jesse,
you cannot be serious.

211
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:04,277
Listen, this is
a ridiculous idea.

212
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:05,612
It's ridiculous?

213
00:13:05,646 --> 00:13:08,815
What, so you're saying
it's not going to work?

214
00:13:08,849 --> 00:13:11,784
How about back
when it was your plan?

215
00:13:11,819 --> 00:13:13,720
Back when you were
going to use it on Tuco?

216
00:13:13,754 --> 00:13:15,755
Apples and oranges.

217
00:13:15,789 --> 00:13:17,023
Guy eats ricin.

218
00:13:17,057 --> 00:13:19,058
Two or three days later,
he gets the flu

219
00:13:19,093 --> 00:13:21,494
or a heart attack or something,
and he keels over.

220
00:13:21,528 --> 00:13:22,562
That's what you said.

221
00:13:22,596 --> 00:13:25,198
Untraceable back to us.

222
00:13:25,232 --> 00:13:28,001
To-- To me.

223
00:13:28,035 --> 00:13:29,936
Not even that other scumbag
we work for

224
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,537
is ever going to figure it out.

225
00:13:31,572 --> 00:13:34,474
Yo, it was a good plan
back when it was Tuco,

226
00:13:34,508 --> 00:13:37,043
and it's a good plan now.

227
00:13:37,077 --> 00:13:39,612
Tuco wanted to murder us.

228
00:13:39,647 --> 00:13:42,649
These guys don't.

229
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,317
Apples and oranges.

230
00:13:44,351 --> 00:13:46,019
Do I really have to sit here

231
00:13:46,053 --> 00:13:47,520
and explain the difference
to you?

232
00:13:47,554 --> 00:13:51,858
Combo was us, man.

233
00:13:51,892 --> 00:13:54,027
He was one of us.

234
00:13:54,061 --> 00:13:55,395
Does that mean nothing?

235
00:13:55,429 --> 00:13:58,431
Why didn't you
go after these guys

236
00:13:58,465 --> 00:13:59,832
two or three months ago?

237
00:13:59,867 --> 00:14:02,201
Because I just found out
about them.

238
00:14:02,236 --> 00:14:03,736
What's to find out?

239
00:14:03,771 --> 00:14:05,738
It's a dispute over turf,
right?

240
00:14:05,773 --> 00:14:07,206
I mean, how hard
could it have been

241
00:14:07,241 --> 00:14:09,142
for you to track them down

242
00:14:09,176 --> 00:14:10,877
on their turf

243
00:14:10,911 --> 00:14:13,846
and kill them months ago?

244
00:14:13,881 --> 00:14:16,082
Because back then

245
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:18,184
you were too busy getting high,

246
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:19,986
feeling sorry.

247
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:23,656
Now, murder...

248
00:14:23,691 --> 00:14:27,393
is not part
of your 12-step program.

249
00:14:27,428 --> 00:14:31,164
This is not some amends
that you have to make.

250
00:14:31,198 --> 00:14:34,567
What you are talking
about here is pointless.

251
00:14:35,703 --> 00:14:38,504
This achieves nothing.

252
00:14:38,539 --> 00:14:41,174
It accomplishes nothing.

253
00:14:46,046 --> 00:14:49,449
If you don't see
what it accomplishes,

254
00:14:49,483 --> 00:14:51,551
then there's no way
I can explain it to you.

255
00:14:53,253 --> 00:14:55,621
Jesse, listen to me.

256
00:14:55,656 --> 00:14:59,258
You are not a murderer.

257
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:02,061
I'm not, and you're not.

258
00:15:03,230 --> 00:15:05,631
It's as simple as that.

259
00:15:10,304 --> 00:15:11,637
Jesse...

260
00:15:13,507 --> 00:15:16,075
I'm doing it...

261
00:15:16,110 --> 00:15:18,544
with or without you.

262
00:15:48,295 --> 00:15:49,796
Knock, knock.

263
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,898
Christ sakes, Marie,
you don't say "knock, knock."

264
00:15:51,932 --> 00:15:53,099
You--

265
00:15:53,133 --> 00:15:55,134
Like that.
Well, I like saying it.

266
00:15:55,169 --> 00:15:58,404
Yeah, well, that's
not the rules. Okay?

267
00:15:58,438 --> 00:16:00,473
Listen, you knock your way, Groucho.
I'll knock mine.

268
00:16:00,507 --> 00:16:02,575
But, look, see?
I win.

269
00:16:02,609 --> 00:16:04,010
Not so fast.

270
00:16:05,679 --> 00:16:07,914
Christ, again?
That's three in a row.

271
00:16:07,948 --> 00:16:10,716
Frickin' Paul Newman over here?

272
00:16:10,751 --> 00:16:12,552
Have you been playing cards
with your dad?

273
00:16:12,586 --> 00:16:14,153
No, why?

274
00:16:15,522 --> 00:16:17,023
How is your old man?

275
00:16:17,057 --> 00:16:18,791
He back teaching?

276
00:16:18,826 --> 00:16:22,028
No, I don't think either
of them are working right--

277
00:16:22,062 --> 00:16:23,296
right now.

278
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:24,730
Yeah?
How they swinging that?

279
00:16:24,765 --> 00:16:27,166
Hey.

280
00:16:27,201 --> 00:16:30,469
Did you know that the doctor
has told your Uncle Hank

281
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:32,205
that he can get out of here
any time he wants to.

282
00:16:32,239 --> 00:16:34,607
Oh, yeah?
That's great.

283
00:16:34,641 --> 00:16:36,809
Yeah, well,
we're not so sure about that.

284
00:16:36,844 --> 00:16:38,344
Why not?

285
00:16:38,378 --> 00:16:40,580
What? That's what they said.

286
00:16:40,614 --> 00:16:42,548
That's what they said
because they want the room.

287
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:44,584
They hit the sheets with Lysol,

288
00:16:44,618 --> 00:16:46,686
re-set the meter, and wheel
the next slob in here.

289
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,155
We went over this, Marie.
Drop it.

290
00:16:51,325 --> 00:16:53,626
Are you not well enough?

291
00:16:53,660 --> 00:16:56,395
Jesus, kid, you, too?

292
00:16:56,430 --> 00:16:57,930
Do I look well enough?

293
00:16:57,965 --> 00:17:00,967
I'm shitting in pants,
peeing in pitchers.

294
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,836
Can't move my legs.
Got it?

295
00:17:03,871 --> 00:17:07,240
So people in wheelchairs
should be in hospitals?

296
00:17:07,274 --> 00:17:09,575
What about people on crutches?

297
00:17:09,610 --> 00:17:12,545
Maybe I should be in here, too.

298
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,080
Is that what
you're trying to say?

299
00:17:14,114 --> 00:17:15,581
Yeah, that's exactly
what I'm saying.

300
00:17:15,616 --> 00:17:17,183
Deal, you little perk.

301
00:17:18,652 --> 00:17:20,453
[sighs]

302
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:36,035
[sighs]

303
00:17:36,069 --> 00:17:38,271
Bitch.

304
00:17:39,506 --> 00:17:41,374
You know I'm hourly, right?

305
00:17:44,244 --> 00:17:46,279
He promised me he'd be here.

306
00:17:46,313 --> 00:17:48,948
Oh, he promised, huh?
Well, why didn't you tell me?

307
00:17:48,982 --> 00:17:50,783
Let's wait, then.

308
00:17:50,817 --> 00:17:52,585
That's a joke.
The kid ain't coming.

309
00:17:52,619 --> 00:17:56,022
Okay, so what's Plan B?

310
00:17:56,056 --> 00:17:58,224
I don't know.

311
00:17:58,258 --> 00:17:59,392
I really don't.

312
00:17:59,426 --> 00:18:01,193
Well, let's brainstorm.

313
00:18:01,228 --> 00:18:03,629
You really think he's serious?

314
00:18:03,664 --> 00:18:05,698
That's why I'm here, Saul.

315
00:18:05,732 --> 00:18:08,401
The way he was talking,
he is going to do it.

316
00:18:08,435 --> 00:18:10,503
Or try, at least.

317
00:18:10,537 --> 00:18:12,705
Okay, so, what, we pay him off.

318
00:18:12,739 --> 00:18:14,373
No. No, it's not about money.

319
00:18:14,408 --> 00:18:16,642
It's about getting him
off the streets,

320
00:18:16,677 --> 00:18:19,545
getting him to calm down.

321
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:20,846
Maybe--

322
00:18:25,686 --> 00:18:28,387
What if we... maybe--

323
00:18:30,891 --> 00:18:33,059
Could you get him arrested?

324
00:18:34,328 --> 00:18:35,695
[laughs]
You--

325
00:18:35,729 --> 00:18:39,265
You want your criminal associate
taken into police custody?

326
00:18:39,299 --> 00:18:40,533
No, now, listen.

327
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,301
I know it sounds risky,

328
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:44,737
but it wouldn't be anything that
would get him into real trouble

329
00:18:44,771 --> 00:18:46,839
and nothing that could lead
back to our business.

330
00:18:46,873 --> 00:18:49,408
Just some minor offense.

331
00:18:49,443 --> 00:18:51,811
[laughs] Pinkman in
jail-- I don't know.

332
00:18:51,845 --> 00:18:54,380
I'm picturing it and--
No, not in jail

333
00:18:54,414 --> 00:18:58,317
as in... "jail" jail.

334
00:18:58,352 --> 00:19:01,420
I'm talking about
one of those situations

335
00:19:01,455 --> 00:19:03,589
where you're
in an orange jumpsuit

336
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:05,658
picking up litter
along the highway.

337
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,193
That's jail.

338
00:19:09,129 --> 00:19:11,564
You're talking
about a level-two joint.

339
00:19:11,598 --> 00:19:14,734
Something that keeps him off
the street for, say, 30 days.

340
00:19:14,768 --> 00:19:16,168
Then by the time he gets out,

341
00:19:16,203 --> 00:19:19,338
tempers have cooled
and hopefully we can move on.

342
00:19:19,373 --> 00:19:23,776
Well, Roswell Correctional's
pretty low impact.

343
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:25,711
In the past
I've recommended Springer,

344
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,347
but hearing chancy things

345
00:19:28,382 --> 00:19:29,615
about their bathrooms

346
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,753
since they renovated, so...

347
00:19:33,787 --> 00:19:36,055
So it's possible, right?

348
00:19:36,089 --> 00:19:40,159
Yeah, well, it falls under
my premium-services package,

349
00:19:40,193 --> 00:19:41,961
but you can afford that.

350
00:19:41,995 --> 00:19:44,163
I'll call my P.I.

351
00:19:49,002 --> 00:19:50,770
[Jesse] You understand
what you have to do?

352
00:19:54,508 --> 00:19:57,410
You can never talk to anyone.

353
00:19:57,444 --> 00:19:58,444
Right?

354
00:20:01,114 --> 00:20:03,883
I mean, ever.
Understand?

355
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,451
Yeah.

356
00:20:09,589 --> 00:20:12,358
I found this stuff
on the Internet.

357
00:20:12,392 --> 00:20:14,560
Takes days to kick in.

358
00:20:14,594 --> 00:20:15,861
Just keep quiet,

359
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:17,897
and this won't ever
come back to you.

360
00:20:20,033 --> 00:20:21,467
You're okay with this, right?

361
00:20:24,771 --> 00:20:27,540
Just think of it like
it's the same thing as always.

362
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:29,341
You're just delivering
some hamburgers.

363
00:20:33,180 --> 00:20:35,314
It's not just delivering
hamburgers.

364
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,885
Hey, you got a kid.

365
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:41,287
Right?

366
00:20:41,321 --> 00:20:43,322
What's his name?

367
00:20:43,356 --> 00:20:44,824
Patrick.

368
00:20:44,858 --> 00:20:46,725
Imagine these two guys

369
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:49,995
and Patrick working as a mule,

370
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:52,298
making him kill people.

371
00:20:52,332 --> 00:20:54,800
Wouldn't you do anything
to protect your kid?

372
00:20:54,835 --> 00:20:56,102
Of course I would.

373
00:20:56,136 --> 00:20:58,304
I do all kinds of things
for him.

374
00:21:01,174 --> 00:21:03,943
Okay, so...

375
00:21:03,977 --> 00:21:08,380
these guys using kids
like that,

376
00:21:08,415 --> 00:21:10,249
they got to go.

377
00:21:10,283 --> 00:21:11,383
Right?

378
00:21:18,058 --> 00:21:19,592
Good.

379
00:21:26,933 --> 00:21:28,234
Tomorrow.

380
00:21:29,569 --> 00:21:31,170
I'll be in touch.

381
00:21:50,891 --> 00:21:52,458
Yeah.

382
00:21:52,492 --> 00:21:54,059
Bet that tastes good, huh?

383
00:21:54,094 --> 00:21:56,962
[chomping]

384
00:21:56,997 --> 00:21:58,097
[knock on door]

385
00:21:59,933 --> 00:22:01,333
Yeah.

386
00:22:02,369 --> 00:22:03,569
Come here.

387
00:22:05,772 --> 00:22:07,940
Okay, here we go.

388
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:11,177
Here we go.

389
00:22:15,015 --> 00:22:16,749
[coos]

390
00:22:22,889 --> 00:22:24,123
What are you doing?

391
00:22:24,157 --> 00:22:26,158
If you need to talk,
use the phone.

392
00:22:26,193 --> 00:22:29,395
This isn't a phone talk,
Walter.

393
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:31,130
Your wife's out, right?

394
00:22:32,933 --> 00:22:34,767
Aw.
[chuckles]

395
00:22:34,801 --> 00:22:37,269
Isn't she something?

396
00:22:37,304 --> 00:22:40,172
I got a granddaughter
a few years older.

397
00:22:40,207 --> 00:22:42,641
What can I do for you?

398
00:22:42,676 --> 00:22:45,477
[grumbles] Have a seat, Walter.

399
00:22:48,615 --> 00:22:53,152
I spoke to Goodman about Pinkman
and this plan of yours.

400
00:22:56,456 --> 00:22:57,756
And?

401
00:22:57,791 --> 00:22:59,491
I'm not going to do it.

402
00:22:59,526 --> 00:23:00,626
Why?

403
00:23:00,660 --> 00:23:02,728
Because it's moronic.

404
00:23:02,762 --> 00:23:06,332
Saul said you've done things
like this before.

405
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:07,866
That's not the moronic part.

406
00:23:07,901 --> 00:23:10,169
Okay, so what's the problem?

407
00:23:10,203 --> 00:23:12,404
The problem is
the boss wouldn't like it.

408
00:23:15,342 --> 00:23:16,508
Saul?

409
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:20,079
My boss.

410
00:23:21,615 --> 00:23:22,815
Your boss.

411
00:23:25,819 --> 00:23:28,287
This is
a professional courtesy.

412
00:23:28,321 --> 00:23:31,090
No one knows I'm here.
Understand?

413
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:34,660
But our employer would
find out, like always,

414
00:23:34,694 --> 00:23:36,362
and if Pinkman were arrested,

415
00:23:36,396 --> 00:23:37,696
he'd take it as a problem.

416
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:43,602
Walt, you got
a good thing going here.

417
00:23:43,637 --> 00:23:45,337
We all do.

418
00:23:45,372 --> 00:23:48,407
You want to risk it all
on one junkie?

419
00:23:48,441 --> 00:23:50,309
Now, I realize you two
have a history,

420
00:23:50,343 --> 00:23:52,978
but this kid's been
on the bubble a while now.

421
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:54,680
It's a long time coming.

422
00:23:57,484 --> 00:23:59,184
What is?

423
00:24:00,987 --> 00:24:04,123
Um...

424
00:24:04,157 --> 00:24:07,359
I used to be a beat cop,
long time ago,

425
00:24:07,394 --> 00:24:10,162
and I'd get called out on
domestic disputes all the time.

426
00:24:10,196 --> 00:24:12,665
Hundreds, probably,
over the years.

427
00:24:12,699 --> 00:24:13,899
But there was this one guy,

428
00:24:13,933 --> 00:24:17,036
this one piece of shit
that I will never forget.

429
00:24:17,070 --> 00:24:19,638
Gordie. He looked
like Bo Svenson.

430
00:24:19,673 --> 00:24:21,140
You remember him?

431
00:24:21,174 --> 00:24:23,776
<i>Walking Tall?
You don't remember?</i>

432
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,311
No. Anyway...

433
00:24:25,345 --> 00:24:29,415
big boy-- 270, 280,

434
00:24:29,449 --> 00:24:30,816
but his wife--

435
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:32,785
or whatever she was--

436
00:24:32,819 --> 00:24:37,022
his lady was real small,
like a bird,

437
00:24:37,057 --> 00:24:40,292
wrists like little branches.

438
00:24:40,327 --> 00:24:44,697
Hmm. Anyway, my partner and I get
called out there every weekend,

439
00:24:44,731 --> 00:24:46,765
and one of us would pull her
aside and we'd say,

440
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:50,102
"Come on, tonight's the night
we press charges."

441
00:24:50,136 --> 00:24:53,372
And this wasn't one of those "deep
down he really loves me" set-ups.

442
00:24:53,406 --> 00:24:55,174
We got a lot of those,
but not this.

443
00:24:55,208 --> 00:24:56,942
This girl was scared.

444
00:24:56,976 --> 00:25:00,346
She wasn't going to cross him
no way, no how.

445
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:03,215
Nothing we could do
but pass her off to the EMTs,

446
00:25:03,249 --> 00:25:05,017
put him in the car,
drive him downtown,

447
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:06,752
throw him in the drunk tank.

448
00:25:06,786 --> 00:25:09,922
He sleeps it off.
Next morning, out he goes--

449
00:25:09,956 --> 00:25:11,223
back home.

450
00:25:12,792 --> 00:25:15,828
But one night

451
00:25:15,862 --> 00:25:17,463
my partner's out sick,

452
00:25:17,497 --> 00:25:19,298
and it's just me.

453
00:25:19,332 --> 00:25:20,499
And the call comes in,

454
00:25:20,533 --> 00:25:21,734
and it's the usual crap--

455
00:25:21,768 --> 00:25:24,770
broken-nose-in-the-shower
kind of thing.

456
00:25:24,804 --> 00:25:26,605
So I cuff him,
put him in the car,

457
00:25:26,639 --> 00:25:27,773
and away we go.

458
00:25:28,775 --> 00:25:31,610
Only that night...

459
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:34,046
we're driving into town,

460
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,115
and this sideways asshole

461
00:25:36,149 --> 00:25:37,349
is in my back seat

462
00:25:37,384 --> 00:25:38,617
humming "Danny Boy."

463
00:25:38,651 --> 00:25:40,319
[chuckles]

464
00:25:40,353 --> 00:25:44,289
And it just rubbed me wrong.

465
00:25:44,324 --> 00:25:45,724
So instead of left,

466
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:48,293
I go right, out into nowhere.

467
00:25:48,328 --> 00:25:49,728
And I kneel him down,

468
00:25:49,763 --> 00:25:52,498
and I put my revolver
in his mouth,

469
00:25:52,532 --> 00:25:54,500
and I told him,

470
00:25:54,534 --> 00:25:55,968
"This is it.

471
00:25:56,002 --> 00:25:58,737
This is how it ends."

472
00:25:58,772 --> 00:26:00,038
And he's crying,

473
00:26:00,073 --> 00:26:02,241
going to the bathroom
all over himself,

474
00:26:02,275 --> 00:26:04,710
swearing to God
he's going to leave her alone,

475
00:26:04,744 --> 00:26:06,111
screaming...

476
00:26:06,146 --> 00:26:08,947
as much as you can
with a gun in your mouth.

477
00:26:08,982 --> 00:26:12,050
And I told him to be quiet...

478
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:15,888
'cause I need to think about
what I was gong to do here.

479
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:18,557
And of course he got quiet.

480
00:26:18,591 --> 00:26:19,992
Goes still.

481
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,828
And real quiet.

482
00:26:24,264 --> 00:26:26,698
Like a dog waiting
for dinner scraps.

483
00:26:28,001 --> 00:26:30,302
Then we just stood there
for a while.

484
00:26:31,805 --> 00:26:34,973
Me acting
like I'm thinking things over,

485
00:26:35,008 --> 00:26:37,242
and Prince Charming
kneeling in the dirt

486
00:26:37,277 --> 00:26:38,777
with shit in his pants.

487
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:43,415
And after a few minutes

488
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:46,452
I took the gun
out of his mouth,

489
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:50,222
and I say, "So help me,
if you ever touch her again,

490
00:26:50,256 --> 00:26:53,492
"I will such and such
and such and such

491
00:26:53,526 --> 00:26:56,028
and blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah."

492
00:27:00,033 --> 00:27:02,434
Just a warning?

493
00:27:02,469 --> 00:27:04,002
[chuckles]

494
00:27:04,037 --> 00:27:06,238
Of course.

495
00:27:09,275 --> 00:27:11,276
Just trying to do
the right thing.

496
00:27:14,914 --> 00:27:17,816
But two weeks later
he killed her.

497
00:27:17,851 --> 00:27:19,384
Of course.

498
00:27:21,721 --> 00:27:24,823
Caved her head in with the
base of a Waring blender.

499
00:27:27,494 --> 00:27:30,829
We got there, there was so much
blood, you could taste the metal.

500
00:27:33,566 --> 00:27:35,267
Hmm.

501
00:27:35,301 --> 00:27:37,336
The moral of the story is...

502
00:27:39,205 --> 00:27:42,274
I chose a half measure

503
00:27:42,308 --> 00:27:44,276
when I should have gone
all the way.

504
00:27:49,716 --> 00:27:51,850
I'll never make
that mistake again.

505
00:28:01,628 --> 00:28:03,929
No more half measures, Walter.

506
00:28:21,304 --> 00:28:23,339
[Jesse] Man, I don't get this.

507
00:28:23,373 --> 00:28:24,307
I don't get this at all.

508
00:28:25,176 --> 00:28:27,410
All I'm seeing is the kid.

509
00:28:28,846 --> 00:28:30,614
So where are they?

510
00:28:30,648 --> 00:28:32,315
[sighs] I don't know.

511
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:34,151
They're always around.

512
00:28:34,185 --> 00:28:36,820
Burgers are getting cold.

513
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,726
So is it, like, fast?

514
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:48,832
Don't sweat it, all right?
You're just doing what you do.

515
00:28:48,866 --> 00:28:50,500
Nobody's going to know
anything.

516
00:28:52,937 --> 00:28:54,104
Can I have another bump?

517
00:28:54,138 --> 00:28:55,972
You had your bump.

518
00:28:56,007 --> 00:28:58,441
We get this thing done.
Then you can have all you want.

[knock on window]

520

Going to need you
to come with me.

521
00:29:02,413 --> 00:29:03,547
Take a walk.

522
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:44,688
Where are we going?

523
00:31:17,415 --> 00:31:18,982
Sit down.

524
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:33,063
I understand that you have a
problem with two of my employees.

525
00:31:34,732 --> 00:31:38,134
It is true that they killed
one of your associates.

526
00:31:38,169 --> 00:31:41,271
It is possible
they acted rashly,

527
00:31:41,305 --> 00:31:43,306
but, on the other hand,
there was provocation.

528
00:31:43,341 --> 00:31:46,676
A man was selling
on their territory.

529
00:31:48,946 --> 00:31:51,481
There is blame on both sides.

530
00:31:56,487 --> 00:31:58,355
This will go no further.

531
00:31:58,389 --> 00:32:01,992
It will be settled
right here, right now.

532
00:32:03,561 --> 00:32:04,594
You told him.

533
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,834
Wait outside.

534
00:32:22,146 --> 00:32:23,813
Listen to me.

535
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:25,648
You have one friend
in this room.

536
00:32:25,683 --> 00:32:27,150
This man.

537
00:32:28,953 --> 00:32:30,920
Those men outside

538
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:33,690
are my trusted employees,

539
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:37,093
and when I learned
what you intended to do...

540
00:32:39,663 --> 00:32:41,498
If it wasn't for this man

541
00:32:41,532 --> 00:32:43,633
and the respect I have for him,

542
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:47,270
I would be dealing with this
in a very different way.

543
00:32:47,304 --> 00:32:50,740
You don't look at him.
You look at me.

544
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:58,448
This is what happens now.

545
00:32:58,482 --> 00:33:00,617
My men will come back inside,

546
00:33:00,651 --> 00:33:03,420
and you will shake their hands

547
00:33:03,454 --> 00:33:05,188
and you will make peace.

548
00:33:05,222 --> 00:33:07,891
And that will be
the end of this.

549
00:33:11,328 --> 00:33:12,896
No.

Pardon me?

552

They use kids.

553

These assholes of yours,

554
00:33:21,572 --> 00:33:24,274
they got an 11-year-old kid
doing their killing for them.

555
00:33:24,308 --> 00:33:27,444
You're supposed to be some kind
of reasonable businessman.

556
00:33:27,478 --> 00:33:29,045
This how you do business?

557
00:33:31,082 --> 00:33:32,449
You okay with this?

You got anything to say here?

559
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,301
Bring them back.

560
00:34:15,292 --> 00:34:17,227
No more children.

561

Understand?

562
00:34:23,901 --> 00:34:25,268
And you.

563

You keep the peace.

00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:37,247
Say it.

565
00:34:39,316 --> 00:34:41,618
Yeah. I'll keep the peace.

566
00:34:45,856 --> 00:34:47,590
Shake hands.

567
00:35:31,468 --> 00:35:33,636
Jesse, your actions...

568
00:35:35,806 --> 00:35:37,674
they affect other people.

569
00:35:40,811 --> 00:35:43,046
And sometimes

570
00:35:43,080 --> 00:35:45,148
compromises have to be made...

571
00:35:48,185 --> 00:35:50,053
for the best of reasons.

572
00:36:02,066 --> 00:36:04,300

do this, do a lousy job.

what you want, huh?

I got to tell you, Marie?

Well, it's a waste of time.

Besides, what if someone
comes in?

595

Let them. I don't care
if someone walks in.

I'm sorry. I'm betting it will,
