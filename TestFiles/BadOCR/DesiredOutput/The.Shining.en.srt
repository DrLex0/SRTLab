00:03:12,442 --> 00:03:14,776
Hi. I've got an appointment
with Mr. Ullman.

2
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:16,945
My name is Jack Torrance.

3
00:03:17,113 --> 00:03:19,656
His office is the first door
on the left.

4
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,116
Thank you.

5
00:03:38,301 --> 00:03:39,509
-Mr. Ullman?
-Yes.

6
00:03:39,677 --> 00:03:42,971
-I'm Jack Torrance.
-Oh, come on in, Jack.

7
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,600
-Very nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

8
00:03:46,809 --> 00:03:48,810
-This is my secretary, Susie.
-Hello.

9
00:03:48,978 --> 00:03:51,230
-Susie, how do you do?
-Any trouble finding us?

10
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,274
No problem at all.
I made the trip in 3 1/2 hours.

11
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:56,360
That's very good time.

12
00:03:56,694 --> 00:03:58,320
Sit down a minute, Jack.

13
00:03:58,529 --> 00:04:00,322
Just make yourself at home.

14
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,782
Like some coffee?

15
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:04,493
If you're having some,
I wouldn't mind. Thanks.

16
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:05,661
-Susie.
-Sure.

17
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:07,621
And ask Bill Watson to join us.

18
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,248
Yes, I will.

19
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:21,260
Mom?

20
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,303
Yeah?

21
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:27,349
Do you really want to go and live
in that hotel for the winter?

22
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,309
Sure I do.

23
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,436
It'll be lots of fun.

24
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,399
Yeah. I guess so.

25
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:39,778
Anyway, there's hardly anybody
to play with around here.

26
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,199
I know. It always takes
a little time to make new friends.

27
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:47,995
Yeah, I guess so.

28
00:04:48,746 --> 00:04:49,788
What about Tony?

29
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:52,374
He's looking forward
to the hotel, I bet.

30
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,294
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

31
00:04:55,712 --> 00:04:58,130
Now, come on, Tony.
Don't be silly.

32
00:04:58,548 --> 00:05:00,549
I don't want to go there.

33
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:03,051
How come you don't want to go?

34
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:05,387
I just don't.

35
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,390
Let's just wait and see.

36
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,351
We're all going to have
a real good time.

37
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:15,188
Bill, I'd like you
to meet Jack Torrance.

38
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,815
How do you do, Bill?

39
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,984
-Nice to meet you.
-Pleasure to meet you.

40
00:05:19,193 --> 00:05:21,111
Grab a chair, Bill. Join in.

41
00:05:21,321 --> 00:05:25,449
Jack is going to take care of
the Overlook for us this winter.

42
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,618
I'd like you to take him around
soon as we're through.

43
00:05:28,786 --> 00:05:29,786
Fine.

44
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,955
Jack is a schoolteacher.

45
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,583
Uh, formerly a schoolteacher.

46
00:05:34,751 --> 00:05:36,460
What line of work are you in now?

47
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,253
I'm a writer.

48
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:42,132
Teaching's been more or less
a way of making ends meet.

49
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:44,301
This ought to be
quite a change for you.

50
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:47,054
Well, I'm looking for a change.

51
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:50,849
Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

52
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,642
...I agree with them.

53
00:05:53,269 --> 00:05:55,103
Let's see, where were we?

54
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,898
I was about to explain...

55
00:05:58,107 --> 00:06:02,277
...that our season here runs from
May 15th to October 30th.

56
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:05,947
Then we close down completely
until the following May.

57
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,950
Do you mind if I ask why you do that?

58
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:12,621
It seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

59
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,457
It would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

60
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,210
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

61
00:06:18,836 --> 00:06:20,587
It's a 25-mile stretch of road.

62
00:06:20,797 --> 00:06:23,131
It gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

63
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:26,593
There's just no way to make it
economically feasible...

64
00:06:26,803 --> 00:06:28,720
...to keep it clear.

65
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,306
When the place was built in 1907...

66
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:34,059
...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

67
00:06:34,268 --> 00:06:39,147
This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

68
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,900
It's certainly got plenty of that.

69
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,318
That's right.

70
00:06:43,986 --> 00:06:46,822
Did they give you any idea in Denver...

71
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,698
...about what the job entails?

72
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,992
Only in a very general way.

73
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,245
Well...

74
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:56,081
...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

75
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,751
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

76
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,962
...and depreciation
which can occur.

77
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,589
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

78
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,760
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

79
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:11,680
...repairing damage as it occurs...

80
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,683
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

81
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:18,019
That sounds fine to me.

82
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:21,356
Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

83
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,734
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

84
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,571
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

85
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:33,285
That just happens to be
exactly what I'm looking for.

86
00:07:33,619 --> 00:07:36,746
I'm outlining a new writing project.

87
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,459
Five months of peace
is just what I want.

88
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,961
That's very good, Jack.

89
00:07:43,254 --> 00:07:46,423
Because, for some people...

90
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,383
...solitude...

91
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,218
...and isolation...

92
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,388
...can, of itself, become a problem.

93
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:55,765
Not for me.

94
00:07:56,309 --> 00:07:59,561
How about your wife and son?
Do you think they'll take to it?

95
00:08:01,355 --> 00:08:02,522
They'll love it.

96
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,899
Great.

97
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:10,071
Well, before I turn you over to Bill...

98
00:08:10,239 --> 00:08:13,742
...there's one other thing I think
we should talk about.

99
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,410
Not to sound melodramatic...

100
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:18,163
...but it's been known to
give a few people...

101
00:08:18,372 --> 00:08:20,582
...second thoughts about the job.

102
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,918
I'm intrigued.

103
00:08:23,127 --> 00:08:25,462
I don't suppose they
said anything in Denver...

104
00:08:25,671 --> 00:08:29,633
...about the tragedy we had up here
during the winter of 1970.

105
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:32,260
I don't believe they did.

106
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,763
Well....

107
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,265
My predecessor in this job...

108
00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,477
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

109
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,231
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 10.

110
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,442
He had a good employment record,
good references.

111
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,903
And from what I've been told,
he seemed...

112
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,781
...like a completely
normal individual.

113
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,367
But at some point during the winter...

114
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,204
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

115
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,790
He ran amuck...

116
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,379
...and killed his family
with an ax.

117
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:13,301
Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

118
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,806
...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

119
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,809
The police thought...

120
00:09:21,018 --> 00:09:25,105
...that it was what the old-timers
used to call cabin fever.

121
00:09:25,314 --> 00:09:28,316
A kind of claustrophobic reaction
which can occur...

122
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:32,654
...when people are shut in together
over long periods of time.

123
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:36,324
Wow.

124
00:09:37,743 --> 00:09:39,160
That is...

125
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:40,912
...quite a story.

126
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,665
Yeah, it is.

127
00:09:44,792 --> 00:09:48,086
It's still hard for me to believe
it actually happened here.

128
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,130
But it did.

129
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,715
And, uh...

130
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:55,927
...I think you can appreciate
why I wanted to tell you about it.

131
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,972
I certainly can.

132
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:02,017
I also understand
why your people in Denver...

133
00:10:02,226 --> 00:10:04,519
...left it for you to tell me.

134
00:10:05,688 --> 00:10:08,398
Obviously, some people
can be put off...

135
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:12,694
...from staying in a place where
something like that happened.

136
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:17,824
You can rest assured that's not
going to happen with me.

137
00:10:18,034 --> 00:10:21,703
And as far as my wife
is concerned...

138
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:25,707
...I'm sure she'll be absolutely
fascinated when I tell her.

139
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,752
She's a confirmed ghost story...

140
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:31,379
...and horror film addict.

141
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:39,929
Tony, do you think Dad'll get the job?

142
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,558
He already did.

143
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:47,729
He's going to phone Wendy up
in a few minutes to tell her.

144
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,202
Hello.

145
00:11:02,411 --> 00:11:05,080
-Hi, babe.
-Hi, hon. How's it going?

146
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:08,917
Great. I'm at the hotel and
I still have a lot to go through.

147
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:12,253
I don't think I can get home
before 9:00 or 10:00.

148
00:11:12,421 --> 00:11:13,922
Sounds like you got the job.

149
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:16,841
Right. It's a beautiful place.

150
00:11:17,051 --> 00:11:19,177
You and Danny are going to love it.

151
00:11:20,638 --> 00:11:23,556
Tony, why don't you want to go
to the hotel?

152
00:11:23,808 --> 00:11:25,558
I don't know.

153
00:11:26,602 --> 00:11:30,146
You do too know.
Now come on, tell me.

154
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,774
I don't want to.

155
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:34,776
Please.

156
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,112
No.

157
00:11:37,446 --> 00:11:39,531
Now, Tony, tell me.

158
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,147
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

159
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,862
That's good. Now the other one.

160
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,740
Good boy.

161
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,457
Now, Danny...

162
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,959
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

163
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,171
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

164
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:41,134
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

165
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,138
No.

166
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,683
Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

167
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,560
Yes.

168
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,356
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

169
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,698
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

170
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,620
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

171
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,748
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

172
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,044
Talking to Tony.

173
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,047
ls Tony one of your animals?

174
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,884
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

175
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,553
Tony's his imaginary friend.

176
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,388
Oh.

177
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,893
If you were to open your mouth now,
could I see Tony?

178
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,103
No.

179
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,814
Why not?

180
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,900
Because he hides.

181
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,319
Where does he go?

182
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,239
To my stomach.

183
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,160
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

184
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,917
I don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

185
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,378
Okay.

186
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,963
That's fine.

187
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,549
All right, Danny.

188
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,135
I'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

189
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,722
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

190
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,057
Do I have to?

191
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,518
Yes. I'd like you to.

192
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,479
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

193
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,065
I'll come back and check on you.

194
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,109
-Okay.
-Bye.

195
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,742
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

196
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,290
-Please.
-Thank you.

197
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,548
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

198
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,802
I'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

199
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,971
Yeah?

200
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,973
Oh.

201
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,643
He seems absolutely fine now.

202
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,853
But you should've seen him.

203
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,563
I know.

204
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,481
Kids can scare you to death.

205
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,526
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

206
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,321
And they look much worse
than they are.

207
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,490
But what was the matter with him?

208
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,828
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

209
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:18,875
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

210
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,670
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

211
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,840
...a kind of self-induced trance.

212
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,009
If it reoccurs, which I doubt...

213
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,013
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

214
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,932
No, thank you.

215
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,851
I'm sure you're right.

216
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,189
Have you been in Boulder long?

217
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,316
Only about three months.

218
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,861
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

219
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,700
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

220
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,952
Tony.

221
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,122
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

222
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,042
No, um....

223
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,543
Let's see....

224
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,838
I guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

225
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,716
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

226
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,427
Did he adjust well to school?

227
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,471
No.

228
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,556
He didn't like it too much at first.

229
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,060
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

230
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,399
Yeah, I guess that's about when I first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

231
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,777
What sort of injury did he have?

232
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,613
He dislocated his shoulder.

233
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,366
How did he manage to do that?

234
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,872
It was just one of
those things, you know.

235
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,083
Purely an accident.

236
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,837
My husband had been drinking...

237
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,382
...and he came home
about three hours late.

238
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,262
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

239
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,767
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

240
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:04,272
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

241
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,525
It's just the sort of thing you do
100 times with a child...

242
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,777
...you know, in a park or in the street.

243
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,489
But on this particular occasion...

244
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,325
...my husband just used
too much strength...

245
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,120
...and he injured Danny's arm.

246
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,711
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

247
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,505
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

248
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,632
And if I do, you can leave me."

249
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,176
And he didn't.

250
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,889
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

251
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,665
Boy.

252
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,003
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

253
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,672
Mm-hm.

254
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,843
Dad?

255
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,012
Yes?

256
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,348
I'm hungry.

257
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,936
You should've eaten your breakfast.

258
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,689
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

259
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,525
Okay, Mom.

260
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,072
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

261
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,160
I think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

262
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,620
Oh.

263
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,206
What was the Donner party?

264
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,420
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

265
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,924
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

266
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,345
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

267
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,391
You mean they ate each other up?

268
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,686
They had to in order to survive.

269
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,104
Jack.

270
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,397
Don't worry, Mom.

271
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,943
I know all about cannibalism.
I saw it on TV.

272
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,779
See, it's okay.

273
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,407
He saw it on the television.

274
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,939
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

275
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,942
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

276
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,069
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

277
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,406
Good morning. I hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

278
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,242
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

279
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,329
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

280
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,289
-Hi.
-Is your family having a look around?

281
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,834
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

282
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,170
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

283
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,588
Oh, fine.

284
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,673
ln view of all we have to cover today...

285
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,552
...I suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

286
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,263
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

287
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,641
-Fine.
-I'd better collect my family first.

288
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,059
Oh, yes.

289
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,944
This is our Colorado Lounge.

290
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,571
It's beautiful.

291
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,823
My God!

292
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,618
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

293
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,161
It sure is.

294
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,164
I've never seen anything
like this before.

295
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,751
Are all these
lndian designs authentic?

296
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,378
I believe they're based...

297
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,798
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

298
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,967
They're really gorgeous.

299
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,176
As a matter of fact...

300
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,513
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel I've ever seen.

301
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,849
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

302
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,186
ln its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

303
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,356
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

304
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,609
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

305
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,152
Lots of movie stars.

306
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,904
Royalty?

307
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,698
All the best people.

308
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,378
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

309
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,674
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

310
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,802
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

311
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,055
And here are your quarters.

312
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,058
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

313
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,769
And a small bedroom for your son.

314
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,107
Perfect for a child.

315
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,984
-Yeah.
-Yes.

316
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,077
Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

317
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,828
Easy to keep.

318
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,665
Cozy.

319
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,126
Yes, very cozy for a family.

320
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,045
If you feel like spreading out...

321
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,923
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

322
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,052
Well, it's very...

323
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,887
...homey.

324
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,263
Yeah.

325
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,059
This is our famous hedge maze.

326
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,563
It's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 13 feet high...

327
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,066
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

328
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,902
A lot of fun, but I wouldn't
want to go in there...

329
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,114
...unless I had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

330
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,617
When was the Overlook built?

331
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,829
Construction started in 1907.

332
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,997
It was finished in 1909.

333
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,875
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

334
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,710
They actually had to repel...

335
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,839
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

336
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,341
That's our Snowcat.

337
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,343
Can you both drive a car?

338
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,511
Yes.

339
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,181
That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

340
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,934
It won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

341
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,522
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

342
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,233
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

343
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,027
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

344
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,530
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

345
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,700
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

346
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,536
Oh, I'll say!

347
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,540
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

348
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,918
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

349
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,922
I'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

350
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,217
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

351
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,471
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

352
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,638
We don't drink.

353
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,265
Then you're in luck.

354
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,728
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

355
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,063
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

356
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,983
Mr. Hallorann, I'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

357
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,401
Glad to meet you.

358
00:24:47,569 --> 00:24:50,446
The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

359
00:24:50,655 --> 00:24:54,408
That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

360
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,452
It's just wonderful.

361
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,204
Hi, Danny!

362
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,790
I found him outside looking for you.

363
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:05,711
Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

364
00:25:05,879 --> 00:25:07,087
Yeah.

365
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,422
Come on over here.

366
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,132
-Thanks.
-Thank you, Susie.

367
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:14,345
I think it'd be good if you could
show Mrs. Torrance the kitchen...

368
00:25:14,554 --> 00:25:16,430
...while I continue on with Jack.

369
00:25:16,598 --> 00:25:19,058
It would be a pleasure. Right this way.

370
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,809
Great. See you later, hon.

371
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:22,394
Bye, darling.

372
00:25:24,773 --> 00:25:28,108
Mrs. Torrance, your husband
introduced you as Winifred.

373
00:25:28,276 --> 00:25:30,819
Now, are you a "Winnie,"
or a "Freddie"?

374
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,029
I'm a Wendy.

375
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:35,699
Oh, Wendy. That's nice.
That's the prettiest.

376
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,535
This is the kitchen, huh?

377
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,328
This is it.

378
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,997
How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?

379
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,501
Yeah. It's the biggest place I ever seen.

380
00:25:45,752 --> 00:25:48,087
This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

381
00:25:48,296 --> 00:25:51,840
I'll have to leave a trail of
breadcrumbs every time I come in.

382
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,635
Don't let it get you down.

383
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:57,304
It's big, but it ain't
nothing but a kitchen.

384
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:59,723
A lot of this stuff
you'll never have to touch.

385
00:25:59,933 --> 00:26:02,142
I wouldn't know
what to do with it if I did.

386
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:05,479
One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

387
00:26:05,689 --> 00:26:10,359
You folks could eat here for a year
and never have the same menu twice.

388
00:26:10,569 --> 00:26:13,654
Right here is our walk-in freezer.

389
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,866
This is where we keep
all of our meat.

390
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,077
You got 15 rib roasts...

391
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:22,413
...30 ten-pound bags of hamburger.

392
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:25,666
We got 12 turkeys,
about 40 chickens...

393
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:29,003
...50 sirloin steaks,
two dozen of pork roast...

394
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:32,172
...and 20 legs of lamb.
Do you like lamb, Doc?

395
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:34,008
-No.
-You don't?

396
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,759
What's your favorite food, then?

397
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,845
French fries and ketchup.

398
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:40,556
I think we can
manage that too, Doc.

399
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,516
Come along, now.
Watch your step.

400
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:48,272
Mr. Hallorann...

401
00:26:49,232 --> 00:26:50,816
...how'd you know we call him Doc?

402
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:55,029
-Beg your pardon?
-Doc. You called Danny "Doc" twice.

403
00:26:55,238 --> 00:26:57,281
-I did?
-Yeah.

404
00:26:57,449 --> 00:27:00,576
We call him Doc sometimes,
like in the Bugs Bunny cartoons.

405
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,036
But how did you know?

406
00:27:02,245 --> 00:27:04,788
I guess I probably
heard you call him that.

407
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:07,249
It's possible.
But I honestly don't remember...

408
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,668
...calling him that
since we've been with you.

409
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,046
Anyway, he looks
like a Doc, doesn't he?

410
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:14,923
Eh, what's up, Doc?

411
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,969
Now, this is the storeroom.

412
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:22,556
ln here is where we keep...

413
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:25,559
...all the dried goods
and the canned goods.

414
00:27:25,727 --> 00:27:28,187
We got canned fruits
and vegetables...

415
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:32,191
...canned fish and meats,
hot and cold cereals.

416
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,569
Post Toasties, Corn Flakes,
Sugar Puffs...

417
00:27:35,779 --> 00:27:39,823
...Rice Krispies, oatmeal,
Wheatena and Cream of Wheat.

418
00:27:40,075 --> 00:27:42,493
You got a dozen jugs
of black molasses.

419
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:45,913
We got 60 boxes of dried milk....

420
00:27:53,546 --> 00:27:56,006
How'd you like some ice cream, Doc?

421
00:27:58,426 --> 00:28:00,427
Sociables, finger rolls...

422
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,137
...and 7 kinds of what have you.

423
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:05,891
Now, we've got dried peaches,
dried apricots...

424
00:28:06,101 --> 00:28:09,186
...dried raisins and dried prunes.

425
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:13,691
You know, you got to keep regular
if you want to be happy.

426
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,443
-Hi.
- Hi.

427
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:18,237
-How're you getting on?
-Fine.

428
00:28:18,446 --> 00:28:21,990
Can we borrow Mrs. Torrance?
We're on our way to the basement.

429
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:24,118
I promise we won't
keep her very long.

430
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,538
No problem, Mr. Ullman. I was just
getting to the ice cream.

431
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:30,290
-You like ice cream, Doc?
-Yeah.

432
00:28:30,458 --> 00:28:31,458
I thought you did.

433
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:34,712
You folks mind if I give Danny
some ice cream while we wait?

434
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:36,755
-Not at all.
-We don't mind.

435
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:38,632
-Good.
-Sound good to you, Doc?

436
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:41,427
Yeah.
-Okay, you behave yourself.

437
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:46,306
What kind of ice cream do you like?

438
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,516
Chocolate.

439
00:28:47,684 --> 00:28:50,561
Chocolate it shall be.
Come on, son.

440
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:57,151
It's amazing, all this activity today.

441
00:28:57,318 --> 00:29:00,154
The guests and some staff
left yesterday, but the...

442
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:01,780
...last day's always hectic.

443
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,033
Everybody wants to be on their way
as early as possible.

444
00:29:05,243 --> 00:29:09,288
By 5:00 tonight, you'll never
know anybody was ever here.

445
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:11,540
Just like a ghost ship, huh?
-Yes.

446
00:29:17,213 --> 00:29:20,174
Do you know how I knew
your name was Doc?

447
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,183
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

448
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:39,651
I can remember when I was
a little boy...

449
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:42,571
...my grandmother and l
could hold conversations...

450
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,617
...entirely without ever
opening our mouths.

451
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:49,995
She called it "shining."

452
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:54,208
And for a long time I thought
it was just the two of us...

453
00:29:54,417 --> 00:29:57,044
...that had "the shine" to us.

454
00:29:57,670 --> 00:30:00,672
Just like you probably thought
you was the only one.

455
00:30:01,341 --> 00:30:03,217
But there are other folks...

456
00:30:03,384 --> 00:30:07,137
...though mostly they don't
know it, or don't believe it.

457
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,228
How long have you
been able to do it?

458
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:21,860
Why don't you want to talk about it?

459
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,159
I'm not supposed to.

460
00:30:30,745 --> 00:30:33,247
Who says you ain't supposed to?

461
00:30:36,709 --> 00:30:38,085
Tony.

462
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,755
Who's Tony?

463
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:47,594
Tony's the little boy
that lives in my mouth.

464
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:51,598
ls Tony the one that...

465
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:53,350
...tells you things?

466
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:56,478
Yes.

467
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:00,274
How does he tell you things?

468
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:06,405
It's like I go to sleep,
and he shows me things.

469
00:31:06,614 --> 00:31:10,701
But when I wake up,
I can't remember everything.

470
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:16,248
Does your mom and dad
know about Tony?

471
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:18,750
Yes.

472
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,129
Do they know he tells you things?

473
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:25,924
Tony told me never to tell them.

474
00:31:28,052 --> 00:31:31,430
Has Tony ever told you
anything about this place?

475
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:34,182
About the Overlook Hotel?

476
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,021
I don't know.

477
00:31:39,939 --> 00:31:42,316
Now think real hard, Doc.

478
00:31:42,483 --> 00:31:43,984
Think.

479
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:49,823
Maybe he showed me something.

480
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,368
Try to think of what it was.

481
00:31:56,372 --> 00:31:59,666
Mr. Hallorann, are you scared
of this place?

482
00:32:01,169 --> 00:32:02,628
No.

483
00:32:02,795 --> 00:32:05,005
Scared of nothing here.

484
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:07,007
It's just that...

485
00:32:07,717 --> 00:32:10,552
...you know, some places
are like people.

486
00:32:11,387 --> 00:32:13,096
Some shine...

487
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:14,681
...and some don't.

488
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:18,060
I guess you could say
the Overlook Hotel...

489
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,563
...has something about it
that's like shining.

490
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:27,027
ls there something bad here?

491
00:32:35,078 --> 00:32:36,703
Well...

492
00:32:38,623 --> 00:32:41,041
...you know, Doc,
when something happens...

493
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:44,878
...it can leave a trace
of itself behind.

494
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:47,214
Say, like...

495
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,509
...if someone burns toast.

496
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:52,427
Well....

497
00:32:52,595 --> 00:32:57,265
Maybe things that happen
leave other kind of traces behind.

498
00:32:58,434 --> 00:33:01,895
Not things that anyone can notice.

499
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:06,900
But things that people
who shine can see.

500
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,279
Just like they can see things
that haven't happened yet...

501
00:33:11,614 --> 00:33:13,115
...well...

502
00:33:13,574 --> 00:33:17,744
...sometimes they can see things
that happened a long time ago.

503
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:22,124
I think a lot of things
happened right here...

504
00:33:22,333 --> 00:33:26,044
...in this particular hotel
over the years.

505
00:33:26,587 --> 00:33:28,964
And not all of them was good.

506
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:34,928
What about room 237?

507
00:33:38,266 --> 00:33:40,434
Room 237?

508
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,855
You're scared of room 237, ain't you?

509
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:48,108
No, I ain't.

510
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:53,447
Mr. Hallorann, what is in room 237?

511
00:33:54,782 --> 00:33:56,116
Nothing.

512
00:33:56,576 --> 00:33:59,786
There ain't nothing in room 237.

513
00:33:59,996 --> 00:34:03,248
But you ain't got no business
going in there anyway.

514
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,584
So stay out.

515
00:34:05,793 --> 00:34:08,295
You understand? Stay out!

516
00:35:47,812 --> 00:35:49,563
Good morning, hon.

517
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,316
Your breakfast is ready.

518
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:55,735
What time is it?

519
00:35:55,903 --> 00:35:57,779
It's about 11:30.

520
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:01,283
Eleven-thirty, Jesus.

521
00:36:02,243 --> 00:36:04,661
I guess we've been
staying up too late.

522
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:06,413
I know it.

523
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,584
I made them just the way
you like them, sunny-side up.

524
00:36:10,877 --> 00:36:12,419
Nice.

525
00:36:14,714 --> 00:36:16,506
It's really pretty outside.

526
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:19,926
How about taking me for a walk
after you finish your breakfast?

527
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:24,890
I suppose I ought to try
to do some writing first.

528
00:36:26,309 --> 00:36:27,976
Any ideas yet?

529
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:30,645
Lots of ideas.

530
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:32,397
No good ones.

531
00:36:32,857 --> 00:36:35,317
Something will come.

532
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:39,779
It's just a matter of settling into
the habit of writing every day.

533
00:36:40,364 --> 00:36:43,033
Yep. That's all it is.

534
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,454
It's really nice up here, isn't it?

535
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:49,289
I love it.

536
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,374
I really do.

537
00:36:52,293 --> 00:36:55,295
I've never been this happy
or comfortable anywhere.

538
00:36:55,504 --> 00:36:59,299
It's amazing how fast you get
used to such a big place.

539
00:36:59,467 --> 00:37:02,385
I tell you, when we first
came up here...

540
00:37:02,595 --> 00:37:04,638
...I thought it was kind of scary.

541
00:37:05,097 --> 00:37:07,641
I fell in love with it right away.

542
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:11,144
When I came up here
for my interview...

543
00:37:11,479 --> 00:37:15,315
...it was as though
I'd been here before.

544
00:37:15,524 --> 00:37:18,151
I mean, we all have moments
of déjà vu...

545
00:37:18,361 --> 00:37:20,570
...but this was ridiculous.

546
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:23,156
It was almost as though I knew...

547
00:37:23,366 --> 00:37:26,826
...what was going to be
around every corner.

548
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:29,663
Ooh-woo-ooh.

549
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:03,446
The loser has to keep
America clean. How's that?

550
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:06,199
-All right.
-And you're going to lose.

551
00:38:06,409 --> 00:38:09,536
And I'm going to get you.
You'd better run fast!

552
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:15,709
Look out!

553
00:38:15,876 --> 00:38:17,752
I'm coming in close.

554
00:38:17,962 --> 00:38:20,213
Loser has to keep America clean.

555
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,340
Oh, no!
- Keep America clean.

556
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:24,801
Okay. Danny, you win.

557
00:38:25,136 --> 00:38:27,470
Let's take the rest of this walking.

558
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,681
-Okay.
-Whew.

559
00:38:30,016 --> 00:38:31,391
Give me your hand.

560
00:38:34,061 --> 00:38:35,854
lsn't it beautiful?

561
00:38:36,063 --> 00:38:37,063
Yeah.

562
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:54,956
Dead end.

563
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:54,057
Woo, we made it.

564
00:39:54,558 --> 00:39:56,851
-Isn't it beautiful?
- Yeah.

565
00:40:17,498 --> 00:40:19,332
It's so pretty.

566
00:40:19,667 --> 00:40:21,084
Yeah.

567
00:40:23,879 --> 00:40:26,631
I didn't think it was
going to be this big. Did you?

568
00:40:26,799 --> 00:40:28,049
Nope.

569
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:40,520
Rutherford was serving a life sentence...

570
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,522
...for a 1968 shooting.

571
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:46,568
And the search continues
for that missing Aspen woman.

572
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:50,155
Twenty-four-year-old Susan Robertson
has been missing 10 days.

573
00:40:50,364 --> 00:40:53,074
She disappeared on a hunting trip
with her husband.

574
00:40:53,284 --> 00:40:56,077
They may have to
call off the search...

575
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:58,830
...if a predicted snowstorm
moves in tomorrow.

576
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,874
It's so beautiful
in Denver today...

577
00:41:01,083 --> 00:41:03,209
...it's hard to believe
a snowstorm could be close.

578
00:41:03,419 --> 00:41:05,670
I want to go outside
and lie in the sun...

579
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:10,008
...yet to our north, to our west,
it is snowing and cold.

580
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:11,384
And it's moving...

581
00:41:11,594 --> 00:41:14,762
...right here towards Colorado
as we talk. It's incredible.

582
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:44,829
Hi, hon.

583
00:43:48,417 --> 00:43:49,834
How's it going?

584
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:53,546
Fine.

585
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:57,216
Get a lot written today?

586
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,137
Yes.

587
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:06,851
Hey, the weather forecast
said it's going to snow tonight.

588
00:44:12,066 --> 00:44:14,400
What do you want me to do about it?

589
00:44:16,570 --> 00:44:18,738
Come on, hon.

590
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:21,074
Don't be so grouchy.

591
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,825
I'm not...

592
00:44:23,202 --> 00:44:24,410
...being grouchy.

593
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:27,413
I just want to finish my work.

594
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,294
Okay. I understand.

595
00:44:33,545 --> 00:44:36,130
I'll come back later
with a couple of sandwiches.

596
00:44:36,340 --> 00:44:38,800
Maybe you'll let me
read something then.

597
00:44:42,012 --> 00:44:43,096
Wendy...

598
00:44:43,305 --> 00:44:45,932
...let me explain something to you.

599
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:50,687
When you come in and interrupt,
you're breaking my concentration.

600
00:44:50,896 --> 00:44:52,313
You're distracting me...

601
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:55,942
...and it will then take me time
to get back to where I was.

602
00:44:56,151 --> 00:44:57,610
Understand?

603
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:00,613
Yeah.

604
00:45:01,073 --> 00:45:02,240
Fine.

605
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:05,118
We're going to make a new rule:

606
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,786
Whenever I'm in here...

607
00:45:06,954 --> 00:45:08,538
...and you hear me typing...

608
00:45:11,041 --> 00:45:13,960
...or whatever the fuck
you hear me doing in here...

609
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,462
...when I'm in here,
that means I am working.

610
00:45:16,672 --> 00:45:18,923
That means don't come in.

611
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:21,384
Now, do you think
you can handle that?

612
00:45:24,054 --> 00:45:25,471
Yeah.

613
00:45:26,014 --> 00:45:27,140
Fine.

614
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:31,477
Why don't you start right now
and get the fuck out of here?

615
00:45:35,232 --> 00:45:36,649
Okay.

616
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:08,806
All right, you!

617
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,018
I know you've got more.

618
00:46:14,146 --> 00:46:15,188
Missed!

619
00:46:20,778 --> 00:46:21,778
Don't have!

620
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:23,571
No fair anymore.

621
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:22,296
Oh, no.

622
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:32,557
I knew it.

623
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:06,299
This is KDK 12 calling KDK 1 .

624
00:48:08,802 --> 00:48:12,513
KDK 12 to KDK 1 .

625
00:48:12,723 --> 00:48:15,850
This is KDK 1 .
We're receiving you. Over.

626
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:19,353
Hi, this is Wendy Torrance
at the Overlook Hotel.

627
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:22,732
Hi, how are you folks
getting on up there? Over.

628
00:48:22,983 --> 00:48:24,317
We're just fine.

629
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,986
But our telephones
aren't doing too well.

630
00:48:27,195 --> 00:48:30,239
Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

631
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:34,660
Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

632
00:48:34,995 --> 00:48:38,164
Any chance of them
being repaired soon? Over.

633
00:48:38,373 --> 00:48:39,540
Well, I wouldn't like to say.

634
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:43,169
Most winters they stay that way
until spring. Over.

635
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,089
Boy, this storm is really something,
isn't it? Over.

636
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:50,468
Yes. It's one of the worst
we've had for years.

637
00:48:51,011 --> 00:48:54,221
ls there anything else we can
do for you, Mrs. Torrance?

638
00:48:54,681 --> 00:48:56,849
I suppose not. Over.

639
00:48:57,476 --> 00:49:00,770
If you folks have any problems
up there, just give us a call.

640
00:49:00,979 --> 00:49:02,271
And, Mrs. Torrance?

641
00:49:02,481 --> 00:49:06,692
It might be a good idea if you
leave your radio on all the time.

642
00:49:07,527 --> 00:49:09,028
Okay. We'll do that.

643
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,280
It was real nice talking to you.

644
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:14,116
Bye. Over and out.

645
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:51,237
Hello, Danny.

646
00:49:56,493 --> 00:49:58,911
Come and play with us.

647
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:06,585
Come and play with us, Danny.

648
00:50:08,422 --> 00:50:10,256
Forever...

649
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,801
...and ever...

650
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:16,762
...and ever.

651
00:50:48,253 --> 00:50:49,879
Tony...

652
00:50:50,881 --> 00:50:52,923
...I'm scared.

653
00:50:58,388 --> 00:51:01,974
Remember what Mr. Hallorann said.

654
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:07,480
It's just like pictures in a book, Danny.

655
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,815
It isn't real.

656
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:23,120
Please let me give you some money.

657
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:25,331
I wouldn't think of it.

658
00:51:25,582 --> 00:51:26,832
Well, how can I repay you?

659
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:29,710
It's okay. Really.

660
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,463
Well, I'm going to have some coffee.

661
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,173
Would you like some?

662
00:51:35,926 --> 00:51:37,009
Sure.

663
00:51:37,177 --> 00:51:39,053
Great. Sit down.

664
00:51:48,021 --> 00:51:51,607
Ooh, marvelous doughnuts.
Help yourself.

665
00:51:53,235 --> 00:51:55,694
-Coffee will be ready--
- Mom.

666
00:51:57,531 --> 00:51:58,948
Yeah.

667
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:02,785
Can I go up to my room
and get my fire engine?

668
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:06,956
Not right now. Daddy's asleep.

669
00:52:07,916 --> 00:52:10,084
I won't make any noise.

670
00:52:11,503 --> 00:52:13,379
Now come on, Doc.

671
00:52:13,588 --> 00:52:15,297
He only went to bed a few hours ago.

672
00:52:15,507 --> 00:52:17,299
Can't you wait till later?

673
00:52:17,509 --> 00:52:20,636
I won't make a sound.
I promise I'll tiptoe.

674
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,141
Well, all right.

675
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:27,726
But really don't make a sound.

676
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,436
I won't, Mom.

677
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:31,981
Make sure you come right back...

678
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,191
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

679
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,820
-Okay?
- Okay, Mom.

680
00:53:27,078 --> 00:53:30,247
Can I go to my room
and get my fire engine?

681
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:36,170
Come here for a minute first.

682
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,000
How's it going, Doc?

683
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,336
Okay.

684
00:54:19,547 --> 00:54:21,340
Having a good time?

685
00:54:23,426 --> 00:54:24,885
Yes, Dad.

686
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,014
Good.

687
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,394
I want you to have a good time.

688
00:54:34,104 --> 00:54:35,729
I am, Dad.

689
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,779
Dad?

690
00:54:44,197 --> 00:54:45,656
Yes?

691
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:47,992
Do you feel bad?

692
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:52,162
No.

693
00:54:53,915 --> 00:54:56,208
I'm just a little bit tired.

694
00:54:57,794 --> 00:55:00,379
Then why don't you go to sleep?

695
00:55:03,925 --> 00:55:05,509
I can't.

696
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:09,263
I got too much to do.

697
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,059
Dad?

698
00:55:15,729 --> 00:55:17,313
Yes?

699
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,858
Do you like this hotel?

700
00:55:24,195 --> 00:55:25,571
Yes.

701
00:55:26,865 --> 00:55:28,240
I do.

702
00:55:29,242 --> 00:55:30,576
I love it.

703
00:55:32,746 --> 00:55:34,079
Don't you?

704
00:55:36,458 --> 00:55:37,958
I guess so.

705
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:41,795
Good.

706
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:47,343
I want you to like it here.

707
00:55:51,306 --> 00:55:54,725
I wish we could stay here forever...

708
00:55:54,934 --> 00:55:56,727
...and ever...

709
00:55:57,395 --> 00:55:58,729
...and ever.

710
00:56:01,149 --> 00:56:02,441
Dad?

711
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:05,194
What?

712
00:56:06,446 --> 00:56:09,573
You would never hurt Mommy or me,
would you?

713
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,538
What do you mean?

714
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,254
Did your mother ever say that to you?

715
00:56:24,923 --> 00:56:26,715
That I would hurt you?

716
00:56:27,467 --> 00:56:28,842
No, Dad.

717
00:56:31,012 --> 00:56:32,596
You sure?

718
00:56:33,139 --> 00:56:34,681
Yes, Dad.

719
00:56:39,479 --> 00:56:41,522
I love you, Danny.

720
00:56:42,732 --> 00:56:45,317
I love you more than anything else...

721
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,112
...in the whole world...

722
00:56:48,863 --> 00:56:51,949
...and I would never do anything
to hurt you...

723
00:56:52,242 --> 00:56:53,492
...never.

724
00:56:54,327 --> 00:56:56,412
You know that, don't you?

725
00:56:56,579 --> 00:56:58,455
-Hm?
-Yes, Dad.

726
00:56:59,374 --> 00:57:00,499
Good.

727
00:57:41,958 --> 00:57:42,853
Mom?

728
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:30,172
Mom, are you in there?

729
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,654
Jack!

730
00:59:37,115 --> 00:59:40,742
Jack? Jack!

731
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,664
Jack!

732
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,502
What happened?

733
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,920
Honey...

734
00:59:52,797 --> 00:59:54,172
...what's wrong?

735
00:59:55,049 --> 00:59:57,009
Jack?

736
01:00:02,348 --> 01:00:03,765
I had the most...

737
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:06,560
...terrible nightmare I ever had.

738
01:00:08,521 --> 01:00:11,440
-It was the most horrible dream.
-It's okay, it's okay now.

739
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:14,026
Really.

740
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,865
I dreamed that l...

741
01:00:20,074 --> 01:00:22,534
...that I killed you and Danny.

742
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,539
But I didn't just kill you.

743
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:31,585
I cut you up into little pieces.

744
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,797
My God.

745
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,051
I must be losing my mind.

746
01:00:41,346 --> 01:00:43,972
Everything's going to be all right.

747
01:00:46,059 --> 01:00:48,769
Come on. Let's get up off the floor.

748
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,904
It's okay. There. Now sit up.

749
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:03,408
It's okay.

750
01:01:07,455 --> 01:01:08,664
Danny!

751
01:01:08,956 --> 01:01:10,916
Everything's okay!

752
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:14,252
Just go play in your room for a while.

753
01:01:14,587 --> 01:01:16,672
Your dad's just got a headache.

754
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:21,009
Danny, mind what I say.
Go play in your room.

755
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,931
Honey, let me just go
get him out of here.

756
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:27,641
I'll be right back.

757
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,393
Danny.

758
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:31,603
Why don't you mind me?

759
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:35,941
Oh, Danny.

760
01:01:38,236 --> 01:01:40,070
Oh, my God.

761
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,657
What happened to your neck?

762
01:01:44,450 --> 01:01:47,744
Danny, what happened to your neck?

763
01:01:48,246 --> 01:01:49,621
Huh?

764
01:02:16,691 --> 01:02:18,650
You did this to him...

765
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,527
...didn't you?!

766
01:02:22,363 --> 01:02:24,448
You son of a bitch!

767
01:02:24,657 --> 01:02:26,491
You did this to him!

768
01:02:26,701 --> 01:02:28,160
Didn't you?!

769
01:02:29,495 --> 01:02:33,123
How could you?!

770
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:42,382
Oh.

771
01:04:02,964 --> 01:04:06,091
God! I'd give anything for a drink.

772
01:04:08,719 --> 01:04:11,596
I'd give my goddamn soul...

773
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,307
...for just a glass of beer.

774
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,782
Hi, Lloyd.

775
01:04:34,328 --> 01:04:36,746
A little slow tonight, isn't it?

776
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:43,879
Yes, it is, Mr. Torrance.

777
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,424
What will it be?

778
01:04:49,093 --> 01:04:52,053
I'm awfully glad
you asked me that, Lloyd...

779
01:04:52,263 --> 01:04:55,599
...because I just happen to have
two twenties...

780
01:04:55,808 --> 01:04:58,685
...and two tens
right here in my wallet.

781
01:04:58,895 --> 01:05:02,147
I was afraid they were
going to be there until next April.

782
01:05:02,857 --> 01:05:04,691
So here's what:

783
01:05:04,984 --> 01:05:07,319
You slip me a bottle of bourbon...

784
01:05:07,486 --> 01:05:10,322
...a little glass and some ice.

785
01:05:10,489 --> 01:05:12,532
You can do that, can't you, Lloyd?

786
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:15,327
You're not too busy, are you?

787
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,413
No, sir. I'm not busy at all.

788
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:20,498
Good man.

789
01:05:20,791 --> 01:05:21,875
You set them up...

790
01:05:22,168 --> 01:05:25,003
...and I'll knock them back,
one by one.

791
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,090
White man's burden, Lloyd, my man.

792
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,468
White man's burden.

793
01:05:37,516 --> 01:05:38,683
Say, Lloyd...

794
01:05:38,851 --> 01:05:41,645
...it seems I'm temporarily light.

795
01:05:41,979 --> 01:05:44,397
How's my credit in this joint, anyway?

796
01:05:44,690 --> 01:05:47,025
Your credit's fine, Mr. Torrance.

797
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,361
That's swell.

798
01:05:49,570 --> 01:05:51,279
I like you, Lloyd.

799
01:05:51,489 --> 01:05:53,156
I always liked you.

800
01:05:53,366 --> 01:05:55,700
You were always the best of them.

801
01:05:55,868 --> 01:05:58,244
Best goddamned bartender...

802
01:05:58,454 --> 01:06:01,373
...from Timbuktu to Portland, Maine.

803
01:06:01,582 --> 01:06:03,833
Or Portland, Oregon, for that matter.

804
01:06:04,085 --> 01:06:05,877
Thank you for saying so.

805
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:12,842
Here's to five miserable months
on the wagon...

806
01:06:13,052 --> 01:06:17,097
...and all the irreparable harm
that it's caused me.

807
01:06:35,324 --> 01:06:37,784
How are things going, Mr. Torrance?

808
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:41,746
Things could be better.

809
01:06:43,249 --> 01:06:46,001
Things could be
a whole lot better.

810
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:49,212
I hope it's nothing serious.

811
01:06:49,505 --> 01:06:50,922
No.

812
01:06:52,216 --> 01:06:54,217
Nothing serious.

813
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:58,430
Just a little problem with...

814
01:06:58,597 --> 01:07:01,766
...the old sperm bank upstairs.

815
01:07:01,934 --> 01:07:04,310
Nothing I can't handle, though.

816
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:06,229
Thanks.

817
01:07:06,689 --> 01:07:07,689
Women.

818
01:07:07,898 --> 01:07:09,441
Can't live with them...

819
01:07:09,608 --> 01:07:11,443
...can't live without them.

820
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,239
Words of wisdom, Lloyd.

821
01:07:16,449 --> 01:07:17,907
Words of...

822
01:07:18,117 --> 01:07:19,617
...wisdom.

823
01:07:31,130 --> 01:07:34,382
I never laid a hand on him,
goddamn it.

824
01:07:34,592 --> 01:07:36,217
I didn't.

825
01:07:38,262 --> 01:07:42,849
I wouldn't touch one hair
on his goddamn little head.

826
01:07:43,476 --> 01:07:46,603
I love the little son of a bitch.

827
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:51,024
I'd do anything for him.

828
01:07:51,233 --> 01:07:54,027
Any fucking thing for him.

829
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,658
But that bitch!

830
01:08:01,660 --> 01:08:03,369
As long as I live...

831
01:08:03,662 --> 01:08:07,040
...she'll never let me forget
what happened.

832
01:08:16,675 --> 01:08:19,511
I did hurt him once, okay?

833
01:08:19,845 --> 01:08:21,930
It was an accident.

834
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,849
Completely unintentional.

835
01:08:26,102 --> 01:08:28,353
It could have happened to anybody.

836
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:33,525
And it was three goddamn years ago!

837
01:08:33,734 --> 01:08:36,569
The little fucker had thrown all my
papers all over the floor.

838
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:39,239
All I tried to do was pull him up.

839
01:08:42,034 --> 01:08:46,704
A momentary loss of
muscular coordination.

840
01:08:47,039 --> 01:08:48,248
I mean...

841
01:08:48,791 --> 01:08:52,335
...a few extra foot-pounds of energy...

842
01:08:52,545 --> 01:08:55,380
...per second, per second.

843
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:01,010
Jack!

844
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:11,312
Oh, Jack.

845
01:09:11,480 --> 01:09:13,398
Thank God you're here.

846
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,442
Jack.

847
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:18,820
There's someone else
in the hotel with us.

848
01:09:19,029 --> 01:09:21,573
There's a crazy woman
in one of the rooms.

849
01:09:21,740 --> 01:09:24,325
She tried to strangle Danny.

850
01:09:26,871 --> 01:09:29,247
Are you out of your fucking mind?

851
01:09:29,540 --> 01:09:31,040
No.

852
01:09:31,208 --> 01:09:32,750
It's the truth! Really.

853
01:09:32,918 --> 01:09:35,420
I swear it. Danny told me.

854
01:09:35,754 --> 01:09:37,630
He went up into one of the bedrooms.

855
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:41,301
The door was open, and he saw this
crazy woman in the bathtub.

856
01:09:41,510 --> 01:09:43,845
She tried to strangle him!

857
01:09:47,558 --> 01:09:49,309
Which room was it?

858
01:09:56,942 --> 01:09:59,110
From Channel 10 in Miami...

859
01:09:59,278 --> 01:10:01,654
...this is Newswatch
with Glenn Rinker...

860
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:06,075
...Ann Bishop, and
the award-winning Newswatch team.

861
01:10:06,410 --> 01:10:08,828
Good evening. I'm Glenn Rinker,
Newswatch Ten.

862
01:10:09,038 --> 01:10:12,165
As Miami continues to swelter
in a record winter heat wave...

863
01:10:12,374 --> 01:10:14,500
...bringing temperatures to the 90s...

864
01:10:14,710 --> 01:10:17,837
...Central and Mountain states
are buried in snow.

865
01:10:18,047 --> 01:10:22,050
In Colorado, 10 inches of snow
fell in just a few hours tonight.

866
01:10:22,259 --> 01:10:24,469
Travel in the Rockies
is almost impossible.

867
01:10:24,678 --> 01:10:27,639
Airports are shut down, stranding
thousands of passengers.

868
01:10:27,848 --> 01:10:29,766
Highways are blocked
by snowdrifts.

869
01:10:29,975 --> 01:10:31,726
Railroad tracks are frozen.

870
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:33,978
Officials in Colorado
tell Newswatch...

871
01:10:34,146 --> 01:10:37,732
...at least three have been killed
by exposure to freezing winds.

872
01:10:37,942 --> 01:10:40,235
The governor of Colorado is expected...

873
01:10:40,444 --> 01:10:42,153
...to declare a weather emergency.

874
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,197
The National Guard
might be called out...

875
01:10:44,406 --> 01:10:45,615
...to clear streets and roads.

876
01:10:45,824 --> 01:10:48,034
Weather forecasters
predict more snow...

877
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,245
...and heavy winds
tonight and tomorrow...

878
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:53,081
...with temperatures dropping
well below zero.

879
01:10:53,290 --> 01:10:56,292
Back here in Florida,
we've got the opposite problem.

880
01:10:56,502 --> 01:10:58,711
The heat and humidity
are supposed to climb.

881
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,880
Local beaches should be jammed.

882
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:03,132
Our weather expert,
Walter Cronice...

883
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,594
...will have the local forecast
later on Newswatch.

884
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:43,014
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

885
01:16:43,348 --> 01:16:46,517
If you need assistance,
please call the operator.

886
01:17:02,075 --> 01:17:03,409
Jack?

887
01:17:03,744 --> 01:17:05,578
Yes, it's me.

888
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:07,204
Thank God.

889
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:13,669
Did you find anything?

890
01:17:13,879 --> 01:17:16,589
No. Nothing at all.

891
01:17:17,215 --> 01:17:20,384
I didn't see one goddamn thing.

892
01:17:23,096 --> 01:17:26,599
You went into the room Danny said?
To 237?

893
01:17:26,808 --> 01:17:28,392
Yes, I did.

894
01:17:28,852 --> 01:17:30,645
And you didn't see anything at all?

895
01:17:30,854 --> 01:17:32,855
Absolutely nothing.

896
01:17:33,065 --> 01:17:34,315
How is he?

897
01:17:34,524 --> 01:17:36,317
He's still asleep.

898
01:17:36,735 --> 01:17:37,860
Good.

899
01:17:43,659 --> 01:17:46,744
I'm sure he'll be himself again
in the morning.

900
01:17:51,249 --> 01:17:53,751
Are you sure it was the right room?

901
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:57,088
I mean, maybe Danny made a mistake.

902
01:17:57,297 --> 01:17:59,674
He must have gone in that room.

903
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:02,551
The door was open,
the lights were on.

904
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,515
I just don't understand it.

905
01:18:11,853 --> 01:18:14,897
What about those bruises on his neck?

906
01:18:17,067 --> 01:18:19,402
Somebody did that to him.

907
01:18:27,661 --> 01:18:29,120
I think...

908
01:18:30,789 --> 01:18:33,332
...he did it to himself.

909
01:18:39,339 --> 01:18:40,589
No.

910
01:18:41,258 --> 01:18:43,300
That's not possible.

911
01:18:45,804 --> 01:18:47,346
Wendy...

912
01:18:48,598 --> 01:18:52,268
...once you rule out his version
of what happened...

913
01:18:52,477 --> 01:18:55,104
...there is no other explanation.

914
01:18:55,564 --> 01:18:56,897
ls there?

915
01:18:59,276 --> 01:19:02,153
It wouldn't be that different
from the episode...

916
01:19:02,362 --> 01:19:05,740
...that he had before
we came up here.

917
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:07,158
Would it?

918
01:19:12,664 --> 01:19:14,415
Oh, Jack.

919
01:19:15,083 --> 01:19:18,085
Whatever the explanation is...

920
01:19:21,506 --> 01:19:22,923
...I think we...

921
01:19:23,133 --> 01:19:25,843
...have to get Danny out of here.

922
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,475
Get him out of here?

923
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,352
Yes.

924
01:19:36,646 --> 01:19:38,355
You mean...

925
01:19:39,399 --> 01:19:41,358
...just leave the hotel?

926
01:19:42,402 --> 01:19:43,778
Yes.

927
01:19:50,368 --> 01:19:51,786
It is so...

928
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:54,371
...typical of you to create
a problem like this...

929
01:19:54,581 --> 01:19:57,124
...when I finally have a chance
to accomplish something!

930
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,877
When I'm really into my work!

931
01:20:00,086 --> 01:20:04,048
I could really write my own ticket
if I went back now, couldn't I?

932
01:20:04,257 --> 01:20:08,010
Shoveling out driveways,
work in a car wash.

933
01:20:08,220 --> 01:20:10,304
-Any of that appeal to you?
-Jack...

934
01:20:10,472 --> 01:20:14,225
Wendy, I have let you fuck up my life
so far...

935
01:20:14,392 --> 01:20:18,062
...but I am not going to let you
fuck this up.

936
01:21:35,974 --> 01:21:37,766
Good evening. Forest Service.

937
01:21:37,934 --> 01:21:40,269
Hello, my name is Dick Hallorann.

938
01:21:40,478 --> 01:21:42,897
I'm the head chef at
the Overlook Hotel.

939
01:21:43,106 --> 01:21:45,232
Good evening.
What can I do for you?

940
01:21:45,442 --> 01:21:48,986
I've been trying to make
an urgent phone call up there...

941
01:21:49,195 --> 01:21:52,489
...but the operator said
that the phone lines are down.

942
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:56,327
A lot of lines around here
are down due to the storm.

943
01:21:56,494 --> 01:21:59,163
I hate to put you through
any trouble...

944
01:21:59,372 --> 01:22:02,625
...but there's a family up there
all by themselves with a young kid.

945
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:04,501
And with this storm
and everything...

946
01:22:04,669 --> 01:22:07,588
...I'd appreciate it if you'd give
them a call on your radio...

947
01:22:07,797 --> 01:22:09,798
...just to see if everything's okay.

948
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:11,592
I'll be glad to do that.

949
01:22:11,801 --> 01:22:14,595
Why don't you call me back
in about 20 minutes?

950
01:22:14,804 --> 01:22:16,847
Thank you very much.
I'll do that.

951
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,474
All right, sir.

952
01:22:38,787 --> 01:22:40,746
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

953
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:42,414
Good evening.

954
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:08,440
Hi, Lloyd.

955
01:23:08,650 --> 01:23:10,526
Been away, but now I'm back.

956
01:23:10,777 --> 01:23:12,528
Good evening, Mr. Torrance.

957
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:14,196
It's good to see you.

958
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:17,074
It's good to be back, Lloyd.

959
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,410
What'll it be, sir?

960
01:23:20,245 --> 01:23:22,496
Hair of the dog that bit me.

961
01:23:23,915 --> 01:23:25,582
Bourbon on the rocks.

962
01:23:26,418 --> 01:23:27,793
That'll do her.

963
01:23:41,307 --> 01:23:43,600
No charge to you, Mr. Torrance.

964
01:23:45,020 --> 01:23:46,979
No charge?

965
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:49,606
Your money's no good here.

966
01:23:55,280 --> 01:24:00,000
Orders from the house.

967
01:24:05,957 --> 01:24:07,958
Drink up, Mr. Torrance.

968
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:14,673
I'm the kind of man likes to know
who's buying their drinks, Lloyd.

969
01:24:16,968 --> 01:24:19,928
It's not a matter that concerns you,
Mr. Torrance.

970
01:24:20,138 --> 01:24:22,056
At least, not at this point.

971
01:24:26,853 --> 01:24:29,271
Anything you say, Lloyd.

972
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:31,690
Anything you say.

973
01:24:43,495 --> 01:24:44,495
Oh!

974
01:24:44,662 --> 01:24:47,164
Oh, dear! I'm so sorry, sir.

975
01:24:47,415 --> 01:24:49,708
-Oh.
-Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

976
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:52,294
I've made an awful mess
of your jacket, sir.

977
01:24:52,462 --> 01:24:57,341
Oh, that's all right.
I've got plenty of jackets.

978
01:24:57,550 --> 01:25:00,344
I'm afraid it's advocaat, sir.
It tends to stain.

979
01:25:00,553 --> 01:25:01,678
Advocaat, is it?

980
01:25:01,888 --> 01:25:04,056
Yes, sir. I think the best thing...

981
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,475
...is to come along
to the gentlemen's room...

982
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:09,186
...and we'll get
some water to it, sir.

983
01:25:10,021 --> 01:25:13,357
Looks like you might have got a
spot of it on yourself...

984
01:25:13,525 --> 01:25:14,525
...Jeevesy old boy.

985
01:25:14,734 --> 01:25:17,903
That doesn't matter, sir.
You're the important one.

986
01:25:18,196 --> 01:25:20,614
Awfully nice of you to say.

987
01:25:21,032 --> 01:25:23,909
Of course, I intended to change
my jacket this evening...

988
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,370
...before the fish and goose soiree.

989
01:25:26,579 --> 01:25:28,622
Very wise, sir. Very wise.

990
01:25:28,832 --> 01:25:30,165
Here. I'll just...

991
01:25:31,126 --> 01:25:33,377
...hold this for you there,
Jeevesy.

992
01:25:33,586 --> 01:25:35,379
Thank you, sir. Thank you.

993
01:25:36,422 --> 01:25:40,050
Let's see if we can improve this
with a little water, sir.

994
01:25:40,260 --> 01:25:41,552
All right. I'll just...

995
01:25:41,719 --> 01:25:45,931
...set my bourbon and advocaat
down right there.

996
01:25:46,516 --> 01:25:47,933
Won't keep you a moment.

997
01:25:48,143 --> 01:25:49,560
Fine.

998
01:25:52,605 --> 01:25:54,273
What do they call you, Jeevesy?

999
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:57,067
Grady, sir. Delbert Grady.

1000
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:02,823
Grady?

1001
01:26:02,991 --> 01:26:04,199
Yes, sir.

1002
01:26:05,368 --> 01:26:06,702
Delbert Grady.

1003
01:26:06,911 --> 01:26:08,412
That's right, sir.

1004
01:26:14,377 --> 01:26:16,378
Uh....

1005
01:26:17,130 --> 01:26:18,589
Mr. Grady...

1006
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:21,425
...haven't I seen you
somewhere before?

1007
01:26:21,634 --> 01:26:24,344
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1008
01:26:31,394 --> 01:26:33,228
It's coming off now, sir.

1009
01:26:34,397 --> 01:26:35,647
Uh...

1010
01:26:38,151 --> 01:26:39,735
...Mr. Grady...

1011
01:26:41,237 --> 01:26:43,697
...weren't you once
the caretaker here?

1012
01:26:43,907 --> 01:26:46,700
Why, no, sir. I don't believe so.

1013
01:26:49,746 --> 01:26:53,081
You a married man, are you, Mr. Grady?

1014
01:26:53,291 --> 01:26:54,333
Yes, sir.

1015
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:57,586
I have a wife and two daughters, sir.

1016
01:26:58,630 --> 01:27:00,130
And...

1017
01:27:01,799 --> 01:27:03,091
...where are they now?

1018
01:27:03,301 --> 01:27:07,346
They're somewhere around.
I'm not quite sure at the moment.

1019
01:27:15,480 --> 01:27:16,939
Mr. Grady.

1020
01:27:18,024 --> 01:27:20,442
You were the caretaker here.

1021
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,904
I recognize you.

1022
01:27:25,281 --> 01:27:28,325
I saw your picture
in the newspapers.

1023
01:27:28,785 --> 01:27:30,535
You...

1024
01:27:30,995 --> 01:27:34,539
...chopped your wife and daughter
up into little bits.

1025
01:27:35,041 --> 01:27:36,458
And...

1026
01:27:37,085 --> 01:27:39,002
...then you blew your brains out.

1027
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:50,681
That's strange, sir.

1028
01:27:51,683 --> 01:27:54,434
I don't have any recollection
of that at all.

1029
01:27:58,106 --> 01:27:59,982
Mr. Grady...

1030
01:28:00,400 --> 01:28:03,735
...you were the caretaker here.

1031
01:28:11,536 --> 01:28:14,329
I'm sorry to differ with you, sir.

1032
01:28:16,207 --> 01:28:17,916
But you...

1033
01:28:18,668 --> 01:28:20,502
...are the caretaker.

1034
01:28:22,755 --> 01:28:25,674
You've always been the caretaker.

1035
01:28:28,553 --> 01:28:30,387
I should know, sir.

1036
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,433
I've always been here.

1037
01:28:52,660 --> 01:28:54,870
Did you know, Mr. Torrance...

1038
01:28:55,079 --> 01:28:56,872
...that your son...

1039
01:28:57,248 --> 01:28:59,958
...is attempting to bring
an outside party...

1040
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:02,377
...into this situation?

1041
01:29:04,922 --> 01:29:06,631
Did you know that?

1042
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:11,428
No.

1043
01:29:12,889 --> 01:29:14,973
He is, Mr. Torrance.

1044
01:29:17,310 --> 01:29:18,477
Who?

1045
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,356
A nigger.

1046
01:29:26,444 --> 01:29:27,819
A nigger?

1047
01:29:30,573 --> 01:29:31,990
A nigger...

1048
01:29:32,200 --> 01:29:33,283
...cook.

1049
01:29:39,791 --> 01:29:41,083
How?

1050
01:29:43,336 --> 01:29:45,128
Your son...

1051
01:29:45,546 --> 01:29:48,340
...has a very great talent.

1052
01:29:49,300 --> 01:29:52,803
I don't think you are aware
how great it is.

1053
01:29:53,554 --> 01:29:56,807
But he is attempting to use
that very talent...

1054
01:29:56,974 --> 01:29:58,975
...against your will.

1055
01:30:07,485 --> 01:30:08,777
Well...

1056
01:30:11,531 --> 01:30:14,616
...he is a very willful boy.

1057
01:30:16,994 --> 01:30:19,413
lndeed he is, Mr. Torrance.

1058
01:30:19,622 --> 01:30:22,499
A very willful boy.

1059
01:30:22,708 --> 01:30:24,042
A rather...

1060
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:25,794
...naughty boy...

1061
01:30:26,003 --> 01:30:29,172
...if I may be so bold, sir.

1062
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:38,181
It's his mother.

1063
01:30:40,351 --> 01:30:41,810
She...

1064
01:30:42,019 --> 01:30:44,020
...interferes.

1065
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:50,193
Perhaps they need a good...

1066
01:30:50,403 --> 01:30:52,028
...talking-to.

1067
01:30:52,447 --> 01:30:53,488
lf...

1068
01:30:53,656 --> 01:30:56,241
...you don't mind my saying so.

1069
01:30:57,034 --> 01:30:58,702
Perhaps...

1070
01:30:59,203 --> 01:31:00,912
...a bit more.

1071
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:05,375
My girls, sir...

1072
01:31:05,543 --> 01:31:09,379
...they didn't care for
the Overlook at first.

1073
01:31:10,047 --> 01:31:13,925
One of them actually stole
a pack of matches...

1074
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:16,803
...and tried to burn it down.

1075
01:31:17,889 --> 01:31:19,556
But l...

1076
01:31:19,724 --> 01:31:21,725
...corrected them, sir.

1077
01:31:23,060 --> 01:31:27,189
And when my wife tried to prevent me
from doing my duty...

1078
01:31:27,398 --> 01:31:28,648
...l...

1079
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:31,735
...corrected her.

1080
01:31:45,958 --> 01:31:47,918
We have the Snowcat.

1081
01:31:51,297 --> 01:31:53,089
If the weather breaks...

1082
01:31:53,257 --> 01:31:55,050
...we might just be able...

1083
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:57,093
...to get down the mountain.

1084
01:31:59,972 --> 01:32:02,933
I could call
the forest rangers first...

1085
01:32:03,142 --> 01:32:04,434
...and...

1086
01:32:04,769 --> 01:32:06,645
...tell them that we're coming...

1087
01:32:07,021 --> 01:32:08,188
...so that...

1088
01:32:08,397 --> 01:32:12,484
...they could start searching
for us in case we didn't make it.

1089
01:32:16,280 --> 01:32:18,448
And if Jack won't come with us...

1090
01:32:20,910 --> 01:32:24,621
...I'll just have to tell him that
we're going by ourselves.

1091
01:32:24,830 --> 01:32:26,790
That's all there is to it.

1092
01:32:28,167 --> 01:32:29,668
Redrum.

1093
01:32:30,628 --> 01:32:32,295
Redrum.

1094
01:32:32,463 --> 01:32:35,799
Redrum. Redrum.

1095
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:38,260
-Danny?
-Redrum.

1096
01:32:38,636 --> 01:32:42,389
Redrum. Redrum.

1097
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:44,724
-Redrum.
-What's the matter, hon?

1098
01:32:44,892 --> 01:32:45,892
Redrum!

1099
01:32:46,060 --> 01:32:48,103
Are you having a bad dream?

1100
01:32:49,814 --> 01:32:51,606
Danny?

1101
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:55,277
Hon?

1102
01:33:01,075 --> 01:33:04,995
Danny's not here, Mrs. Torrance.

1103
01:33:10,001 --> 01:33:11,501
Come on, hon.

1104
01:33:12,503 --> 01:33:13,920
Wake up.

1105
01:33:14,839 --> 01:33:17,132
You just had a bad dream.

1106
01:33:18,509 --> 01:33:20,677
Everything's okay.

1107
01:33:24,724 --> 01:33:28,602
Danny can't wake up, Mrs. Torrance.

1108
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:36,610
Danny.

1109
01:33:38,070 --> 01:33:39,863
Wake up!

1110
01:33:41,032 --> 01:33:42,365
Come on.

1111
01:33:42,575 --> 01:33:44,117
Right now.

1112
01:33:44,577 --> 01:33:45,952
Wake up!

1113
01:33:49,999 --> 01:33:54,044
Danny's gone away, Mrs. Torrance.

1114
01:33:56,881 --> 01:33:57,881
Danny.

1115
01:34:03,888 --> 01:34:07,015
This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1116
01:34:07,224 --> 01:34:10,143
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1117
01:34:10,436 --> 01:34:12,228
Are you receiving me?

1118
01:34:15,399 --> 01:34:18,902
This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1119
01:34:19,236 --> 01:34:22,030
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1120
01:34:22,239 --> 01:34:23,907
Do you read me?

1121
01:34:28,245 --> 01:34:31,289
This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1122
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,084
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1123
01:34:34,251 --> 01:34:36,044
Are you receiving me?

1124
01:34:38,631 --> 01:34:41,716
This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1125
01:34:41,884 --> 01:34:44,928
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1126
01:34:45,096 --> 01:34:46,846
Do you read me?

1127
01:34:51,143 --> 01:34:54,104
This is KDK 1 calling KDK 12.

1128
01:34:54,271 --> 01:34:57,774
KDK 1 calling KDK 12.
Are you receiv--

1129
01:35:12,456 --> 01:35:14,332
Good evening. Forest service.

1130
01:35:14,542 --> 01:35:16,793
This is Dick Hallorann again.

1131
01:35:16,961 --> 01:35:20,088
I called a while ago about
the folks at the Overlook Hotel.

1132
01:35:20,256 --> 01:35:21,256
Oh, yeah.

1133
01:35:21,424 --> 01:35:25,135
We tried to contact them several
times but they didn't answer.

1134
01:35:25,302 --> 01:35:28,930
Maybe they got their radio
turned off or they can't hear it.

1135
01:35:29,140 --> 01:35:32,016
If you'd like, I'd be glad
to try again later on.

1136
01:35:32,518 --> 01:35:34,644
That's very nice of you.

1137
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:36,646
I'll call you back later.

1138
01:35:36,814 --> 01:35:37,856
Bye.

1139
01:36:24,945 --> 01:36:27,989
Pardon me, miss.
What time will we get to Denver?

1140
01:36:28,199 --> 01:36:30,366
We're due to arrive at 8:20, sir.

1141
01:36:30,534 --> 01:36:32,160
Thank you very much.

1142
01:37:35,975 --> 01:37:36,975
Durkin's Garage.

1143
01:37:37,184 --> 01:37:38,309
Can I speak to Larry?

1144
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:39,477
Speaking.

1145
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,272
Hi, Larry. This is Dick.
Dick Hallorann.

1146
01:37:42,565 --> 01:37:44,232
Dick! How you doing?

1147
01:37:44,441 --> 01:37:45,775
How's the weather down there?

1148
01:37:45,985 --> 01:37:49,153
I'm not in Florida.
I'm calling from Stapleton Airport.

1149
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:51,114
What are you doing there?

1150
01:37:51,574 --> 01:37:54,993
I just got in from Miami.
I got to get to the Overlook today.

1151
01:37:55,202 --> 01:37:56,828
What's the weather like there?

1152
01:37:57,454 --> 01:38:00,331
The snowplows are keeping things
moving in town...

1153
01:38:00,541 --> 01:38:02,458
...but the mountain roads
are blocked.

1154
01:38:03,002 --> 01:38:05,712
Then I'm going to need a Snowcat
to get up there.

1155
01:38:05,921 --> 01:38:07,755
Can you fix me up with one?

1156
01:38:07,965 --> 01:38:10,049
What's the big deal
about getting there today...

1157
01:38:10,259 --> 01:38:11,801
...especially in this weather?

1158
01:38:12,678 --> 01:38:16,139
Larry, just between you and me,
we got a very serious problem...

1159
01:38:16,348 --> 01:38:18,600
...with the people taking care
of the place.

1160
01:38:18,809 --> 01:38:22,645
They turned out to be
completely unreliable assholes.

1161
01:38:22,855 --> 01:38:24,647
Ullman phoned me last night.

1162
01:38:24,857 --> 01:38:28,234
And I'm supposed to find out
if they have to be replaced.

1163
01:38:29,695 --> 01:38:31,738
How long will it take you
to get here?

1164
01:38:32,072 --> 01:38:33,740
About five hours.

1165
01:38:33,949 --> 01:38:36,159
I'm going to rent a car
here at the airport.

1166
01:38:36,660 --> 01:38:38,411
Okay, I'll take care of it.

1167
01:38:38,621 --> 01:38:41,456
Thanks, Larry.
I really appreciate that.

1168
01:38:41,665 --> 01:38:44,208
That's all right. Drive carefully.

1169
01:38:49,965 --> 01:38:53,217
You're with Hal and Charlie
on Radio 63, KHOW, Denver.

1170
01:38:53,427 --> 01:38:56,012
And we have a bad day out there.

1171
01:38:56,180 --> 01:38:59,557
Heavy snow throughout
the Denver metro area.

1172
01:38:59,767 --> 01:39:01,267
Many mountain passes...

1173
01:39:01,477 --> 01:39:04,354
...Wolf Creek and Red Mountain
passes are closed...

1174
01:39:04,521 --> 01:39:07,857
...and the chain law is in effect
at the Eisenhower Tunnel.

1175
01:39:08,025 --> 01:39:09,692
We hear from the news department...

1176
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:13,112
...only a few flights are
landing at Stapleton Airport...

1177
01:39:13,322 --> 01:39:14,906
...and with storms like this...

1178
01:39:15,115 --> 01:39:18,493
...I guess the entire airport will
be closed within the hour.

1179
01:39:18,661 --> 01:39:22,288
The storm will continue through
the day and the Weather Service...

1180
01:39:22,498 --> 01:39:24,958
...has declared a stockman's
and traveler's advisory...

1181
01:39:25,167 --> 01:39:27,961
...for all areas outlying
the Denver metro region.

1182
01:39:28,170 --> 01:39:29,545
Get the cows in the barn.

1183
01:39:51,026 --> 01:39:52,068
Hon?

1184
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:59,492
Listen to me for a minute, will you?

1185
01:40:03,288 --> 01:40:07,000
I'm just going to go and
talk to Daddy for a few minutes...

1186
01:40:07,209 --> 01:40:09,252
...and I'll be right back.

1187
01:40:10,212 --> 01:40:12,755
I want you to just stay here...

1188
01:40:12,923 --> 01:40:15,425
...and watch your cartoons, okay?

1189
01:40:18,554 --> 01:40:20,013
Okay, hon?

1190
01:40:23,308 --> 01:40:26,185
Yes, Mrs. Torrance.

1191
01:40:34,945 --> 01:40:36,154
All right.

1192
01:40:37,031 --> 01:40:41,117
I'll-- I'll be back
in just about five minutes.

1193
01:40:41,952 --> 01:40:44,287
I'm going to lock the door
behind me.

1194
01:41:33,212 --> 01:41:34,868
Jack?

1195
01:44:10,619 --> 01:44:11,619
How do you like it?

1196
01:44:14,373 --> 01:44:15,831
Jack.

1197
01:44:18,919 --> 01:44:20,461
How do you like it?

1198
01:44:30,389 --> 01:44:33,057
What are you doing down here?

1199
01:44:37,437 --> 01:44:39,772
I just...

1200
01:44:40,232 --> 01:44:41,274
...wanted...

1201
01:44:41,692 --> 01:44:43,442
...to talk to you.

1202
01:44:45,821 --> 01:44:47,071
Okay.

1203
01:44:47,698 --> 01:44:49,156
Let's talk.

1204
01:44:58,959 --> 01:45:00,960
What do you want to talk about?

1205
01:45:06,967 --> 01:45:08,217
l....

1206
01:45:08,885 --> 01:45:12,054
I can't really remember.

1207
01:45:12,848 --> 01:45:14,974
You can't remember.

1208
01:45:15,767 --> 01:45:17,101
No...

1209
01:45:17,477 --> 01:45:18,894
...I can't.

1210
01:45:24,192 --> 01:45:27,445
Maybe it was about Danny?

1211
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:32,533
Maybe it was about him.

1212
01:45:36,163 --> 01:45:39,457
I think we should discuss Danny.

1213
01:45:42,252 --> 01:45:44,086
I think...

1214
01:45:44,463 --> 01:45:48,257
...we should discuss
what should be done with him.

1215
01:45:52,929 --> 01:45:55,556
What should be done with him?

1216
01:46:00,520 --> 01:46:02,313
I don't know.

1217
01:46:02,814 --> 01:46:04,815
I don't think that's true.

1218
01:46:05,025 --> 01:46:07,610
I think you have some
very definite ideas...

1219
01:46:07,819 --> 01:46:09,528
...about what should be done
with Danny.

1220
01:46:09,738 --> 01:46:12,323
And I'd like to know
what they are.

1221
01:46:14,242 --> 01:46:16,035
Well, I...

1222
01:46:16,328 --> 01:46:20,748
...I think maybe he should be taken
to a doctor.

1223
01:46:20,957 --> 01:46:24,251
You think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1224
01:46:24,461 --> 01:46:25,836
Yes.

1225
01:46:26,463 --> 01:46:29,799
When do you think "maybe"
he should be taken to a doctor?

1226
01:46:30,467 --> 01:46:31,801
As soon as possible?

1227
01:46:32,427 --> 01:46:34,762
"As soon as possible?"

1228
01:46:37,432 --> 01:46:38,849
Please.

1229
01:46:40,268 --> 01:46:43,521
You believe his health
might be at stake.

1230
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:46,649
Yes.

1231
01:46:47,984 --> 01:46:50,611
And you are concerned about him.

1232
01:46:50,821 --> 01:46:52,363
Yes.

1233
01:46:53,156 --> 01:46:55,408
And are you concerned about me?

1234
01:46:56,243 --> 01:46:57,410
Of course I am.

1235
01:46:57,619 --> 01:46:59,829
Of course you are!

1236
01:47:00,038 --> 01:47:03,165
Have you ever thought about
my responsibilities?

1237
01:47:03,375 --> 01:47:04,875
What are you talking about?

1238
01:47:05,085 --> 01:47:07,920
Have you ever had
a single moment's...

1239
01:47:08,130 --> 01:47:10,172
...thought about
my responsibilities?

1240
01:47:10,382 --> 01:47:12,675
Have you ever thought
for a single moment...

1241
01:47:12,843 --> 01:47:15,678
...about my responsibilities
to my employers?!

1242
01:47:15,929 --> 01:47:17,763
Has it ever occurred to you...

1243
01:47:17,973 --> 01:47:21,475
...that I have agreed to look after
the hotel until May 1 st?

1244
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,727
Does it matter to you at all...

1245
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:27,022
...that the owners have placed
their complete confidence in me...

1246
01:47:27,232 --> 01:47:30,359
...and that I have signed
a letter of agreement...

1247
01:47:30,569 --> 01:47:33,195
...in which I've accepted
that responsibility?

1248
01:47:33,655 --> 01:47:35,698
Do you have the slightest idea...

1249
01:47:35,866 --> 01:47:39,118
...what a moral and ethical
principal is? Do you?!

1250
01:47:39,494 --> 01:47:42,580
Has it ever occurred to you what
would happen to my future...

1251
01:47:42,789 --> 01:47:45,207
...if I fail to live up to
my responsibilities?

1252
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:47,710
Has it ever occurred to you?
Has it?!

1253
01:47:47,878 --> 01:47:49,420
Stay away from me!

1254
01:47:50,297 --> 01:47:51,380
Why?

1255
01:47:51,673 --> 01:47:54,633
I just want to go back to my room.

1256
01:47:54,843 --> 01:47:56,093
Why?

1257
01:47:56,595 --> 01:47:57,595
Well...

1258
01:47:58,722 --> 01:48:00,764
...I'm very confused.

1259
01:48:01,892 --> 01:48:05,561
And I just need a chance
to think things over.

1260
01:48:06,605 --> 01:48:10,566
You've had your whole fucking life
to think things over!

1261
01:48:10,734 --> 01:48:13,527
What good's a few minutes more
going to do you now?

1262
01:48:14,488 --> 01:48:15,988
Stay away from me!

1263
01:48:16,323 --> 01:48:17,615
Please!

1264
01:48:18,408 --> 01:48:19,450
Don't hurt me.

1265
01:48:19,659 --> 01:48:20,993
I'm not going to hurt you.

1266
01:48:21,203 --> 01:48:22,203
Stay away from me!

1267
01:48:22,370 --> 01:48:23,454
-Wendy.
-Stay away!

1268
01:48:23,663 --> 01:48:24,663
Darling.

1269
01:48:24,873 --> 01:48:26,415
Light of my life.

1270
01:48:26,875 --> 01:48:28,209
I'm not going to hurt you.

1271
01:48:28,418 --> 01:48:30,419
You didn't let me finish
my sentence.

1272
01:48:30,587 --> 01:48:32,796
I said, "I'm not going to hurt you."

1273
01:48:33,006 --> 01:48:35,758
I'm just going to bash
your brains in.

1274
01:48:36,051 --> 01:48:39,011
I'm going to bash them
right the fuck in.

1275
01:48:40,096 --> 01:48:41,639
Stay away from me!

1276
01:48:42,140 --> 01:48:43,182
Don't hurt me!

1277
01:48:43,391 --> 01:48:45,768
I'm not going to hurt you.

1278
01:48:46,061 --> 01:48:47,603
Stay away from me!

1279
01:48:47,812 --> 01:48:48,896
Stay away!

1280
01:48:49,773 --> 01:48:50,981
Please!

1281
01:48:52,025 --> 01:48:53,776
Stop swinging the bat.

1282
01:48:53,985 --> 01:48:55,277
Stay away from me.

1283
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:57,321
Put that bat down, Wendy.

1284
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,031
Stop it!

1285
01:48:59,199 --> 01:49:00,324
Wendy.

1286
01:49:00,492 --> 01:49:01,617
Give me the bat.

1287
01:49:01,826 --> 01:49:02,952
Please!

1288
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:05,412
-Stay away!
-Give me the bat.

1289
01:49:05,622 --> 01:49:06,664
Stop it!

1290
01:49:06,915 --> 01:49:08,332
-Give me the bat.
-Jack.

1291
01:49:08,667 --> 01:49:10,292
-Stay away from me.
-Stop swinging the bat.

1292
01:49:10,502 --> 01:49:11,877
Please stop!

1293
01:49:12,087 --> 01:49:13,295
Give me the bat.

1294
01:49:13,463 --> 01:49:14,713
-Stay away from me.
-Wendy.

1295
01:49:14,965 --> 01:49:16,465
-Stop it!
-Give me the bat.

1296
01:49:16,633 --> 01:49:18,050
-Stay away!
-Give me the bat.

1297
01:49:18,218 --> 01:49:19,802
Ah! Goddamn--!

1298
01:50:35,045 --> 01:50:36,754
What are you doing?

1299
01:50:37,547 --> 01:50:38,547
Hey.

1300
01:50:39,549 --> 01:50:41,050
Wait a minute.

1301
01:50:42,427 --> 01:50:47,515
What are you doing?

1302
01:50:54,230 --> 01:50:55,481
Oh! Oh!

1303
01:51:02,405 --> 01:51:03,906
Wait a minute!

1304
01:51:06,242 --> 01:51:07,868
What are you doing?

1305
01:51:08,078 --> 01:51:09,828
Open the door!

1306
01:51:11,122 --> 01:51:12,164
Goddamn it!

1307
01:51:12,374 --> 01:51:15,918
Let me out of here!
Open the goddamn door!

1308
01:51:19,631 --> 01:51:20,881
Wendy, listen.

1309
01:51:21,299 --> 01:51:24,259
Let me out and I'll forget
the whole goddamn thing.

1310
01:51:24,427 --> 01:51:26,929
It'll be just like nothing ever happened.

1311
01:51:40,235 --> 01:51:42,945
Wendy, baby.

1312
01:51:44,155 --> 01:51:47,449
I think you hurt my head real bad.

1313
01:51:49,077 --> 01:51:50,744
I'm dizzy.

1314
01:51:51,746 --> 01:51:53,956
I need a doctor.

1315
01:52:00,797 --> 01:52:02,005
Honey.

1316
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:07,010
Don't leave me in here.

1317
01:52:15,645 --> 01:52:17,521
I'm going to go now.

1318
01:52:20,608 --> 01:52:22,443
I'm going to try...

1319
01:52:22,652 --> 01:52:25,654
...to get Danny down
the Sidewinder...

1320
01:52:26,322 --> 01:52:28,699
...in the Snowcat today.

1321
01:52:30,952 --> 01:52:32,786
I'll bring back a doctor.

1322
01:52:34,581 --> 01:52:35,998
Wendy.

1323
01:52:38,168 --> 01:52:40,002
I'm going to go now.

1324
01:52:41,004 --> 01:52:42,755
Wendy.

1325
01:52:44,924 --> 01:52:46,675
Yes.

1326
01:52:47,469 --> 01:52:51,263
You've got a big surprise
coming to you.

1327
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:55,350
You're not going anywhere.

1328
01:52:57,020 --> 01:53:01,148
Go check out the Snowcat and the
radio, and you'll see what I mean.

1329
01:53:05,737 --> 01:53:07,446
Go check it out.

1330
01:53:09,574 --> 01:53:11,784
Go check it out!

1331
01:53:15,163 --> 01:53:17,080
Go check it out.

1332
01:55:02,061 --> 01:55:03,645
Wendy?

1333
01:55:05,106 --> 01:55:07,482
It's Grady, Mr. Torrance.

1334
01:55:08,234 --> 01:55:10,193
Delbert Grady.

1335
01:55:11,779 --> 01:55:13,363
Grady?

1336
01:55:18,161 --> 01:55:20,162
Oh, Grady.

1337
01:55:24,417 --> 01:55:26,585
Grady, uh....

1338
01:55:33,718 --> 01:55:35,552
Hello, Grady.

1339
01:55:40,224 --> 01:55:42,017
Mr. Torrance...

1340
01:55:43,978 --> 01:55:47,689
...I see you can hardly
have taken care of the...

1341
01:55:48,441 --> 01:55:50,943
...business we discussed.

1342
01:55:57,659 --> 01:56:00,577
No need to rub it in, Mr. Grady.

1343
01:56:01,454 --> 01:56:05,540
I'll deal with that situation
as soon as I get out of here.

1344
01:56:06,376 --> 01:56:09,127
Will you indeed, Mr. Torrance?

1345
01:56:09,629 --> 01:56:11,463
I wonder.

1346
01:56:12,632 --> 01:56:14,716
I have my doubts.

1347
01:56:15,927 --> 01:56:20,180
I, and others, have come to believe...

1348
01:56:20,390 --> 01:56:23,392
...that your heart is not in this.

1349
01:56:24,018 --> 01:56:26,561
That you haven't the belly for it.

1350
01:56:32,735 --> 01:56:37,030
Just give me one more chance
to prove it, Mr. Grady.

1351
01:56:37,865 --> 01:56:39,783
That's all I ask.

1352
01:56:41,327 --> 01:56:45,580
Your wife appears to be stronger
than we imagined, Mr. Torrance.

1353
01:56:45,790 --> 01:56:47,249
Somewhat more...

1354
01:56:47,458 --> 01:56:49,418
...resourceful.

1355
01:56:49,711 --> 01:56:52,462
She seems to have got
the better of you.

1356
01:56:55,717 --> 01:56:58,385
For the moment, Mr. Grady.

1357
01:56:59,095 --> 01:57:01,263
Only for the moment.

1358
01:57:03,182 --> 01:57:07,352
I fear you will have to deal
with this matter...

1359
01:57:07,603 --> 01:57:11,273
...in the harshest possible way,
Mr. Torrance.

1360
01:57:11,858 --> 01:57:13,442
I fear...

1361
01:57:13,693 --> 01:57:16,278
...that is the only thing to do.

1362
01:57:19,741 --> 01:57:21,825
There's nothing I look forward to...

1363
01:57:22,035 --> 01:57:25,954
...with greater pleasure, Mr. Grady.

1364
01:57:27,331 --> 01:57:30,083
You give your word on that,
do you, Mr. Torrance?

1365
01:57:31,544 --> 01:57:33,587
I give you my word.

1366
01:58:45,701 --> 01:58:51,993
Redrum.

1367
02:00:52,161 --> 02:00:54,371
Redrum. Redrum!

1368
02:00:54,538 --> 02:00:59,542
-Ah!
-Redrum! Redrum! Redrum!

1369
02:00:59,710 --> 02:01:01,294
Danny, stop it!

1370
02:01:01,504 --> 02:01:03,421
Redrum!

1371
02:01:56,559 --> 02:01:59,561
Wendy, I'm home.

1372
02:02:36,891 --> 02:02:39,768
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

1373
02:03:03,876 --> 02:03:05,126
Danny...

1374
02:03:05,294 --> 02:03:07,170
...I can't get out.

1375
02:03:07,963 --> 02:03:09,130
Run!

1376
02:03:09,965 --> 02:03:11,383
Run and hide!

1377
02:03:11,926 --> 02:03:13,051
Run!

1378
02:03:13,260 --> 02:03:14,469
Quick!

1379
02:03:16,180 --> 02:03:20,725
Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in.

1380
02:03:26,482 --> 02:03:29,859
Not by the hair
on your chinny-chin-chin?

1381
02:03:31,404 --> 02:03:33,488
Then I'll huff...

1382
02:03:33,656 --> 02:03:35,573
...and I'll puff...

1383
02:03:35,783 --> 02:03:37,826
...and I'll blow your house in!

1384
02:03:52,758 --> 02:03:54,134
Please!

1385
02:03:54,844 --> 02:03:58,847
Don't!

1386
02:04:17,408 --> 02:04:18,658
Stop it!

1387
02:04:22,872 --> 02:04:24,456
Here's Johnny!

1388
02:04:31,714 --> 02:04:32,964
Ah!

1389
02:07:06,535 --> 02:07:07,785
Hello?

1390
02:07:13,208 --> 02:07:15,001
Anybody here?

1391
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:28,931
Hello?

1392
02:07:30,351 --> 02:07:32,685
Anybody here?

1393
02:07:37,066 --> 02:07:38,650
Hello?

1394
02:07:50,954 --> 02:07:52,789
Anybody here?

1395
02:08:04,885 --> 02:08:07,235
Hello?

1396
02:08:22,778 --> 02:08:24,696
Anybody here?

1397
02:09:03,152 --> 02:09:04,569
Danny!

1398
02:09:05,696 --> 02:09:07,405
Danny-boy!

1399
02:09:10,993 --> 02:09:12,618
Danny?

1400
02:09:15,330 --> 02:09:18,834
Danny.

1401
02:09:25,841 --> 02:09:27,508
Danny?

1402
02:10:53,428 --> 02:10:55,979
Danny!

1403
02:11:48,233 --> 02:11:50,151
I'm coming!

1404
02:11:52,654 --> 02:11:54,614
I'm coming, Dan!

1405
02:12:13,383 --> 02:12:15,009
Danny?

1406
02:12:55,384 --> 02:12:57,802
Great party, isn't it?

1407
02:13:07,270 --> 02:13:10,189
Danny!

1408
02:13:13,110 --> 02:13:15,236
Danny!

1409
02:13:15,445 --> 02:13:17,697
I'm coming!

1410
02:13:20,242 --> 02:13:22,576
You can't get away!

1411
02:13:26,415 --> 02:13:28,916
I'm right behind you!

1412
02:14:23,180 --> 02:14:26,320
Danny!

1413
02:17:27,280 --> 02:17:29,323
-Mommy!
-Danny, come here!

1414
02:17:30,492 --> 02:17:32,243
Mommy.

1415
02:17:37,832 --> 02:17:39,541
Danny!

1416
02:17:40,585 --> 02:17:42,002
Where...?
