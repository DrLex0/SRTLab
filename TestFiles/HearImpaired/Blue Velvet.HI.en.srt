My name is Jeffrey Beaumont. I live near
you. I believe you know my father Tom?

52
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,424
- Beaumont's Hardware Store?
- Sure I do.

53
00:07:47,592 --> 00:07:48,967
I hear he's in the hospital.

54
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:53,054
- How's he doing?
- Well, he's OK, I guess. I hope.

55
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:55,640
They're doing tests.
That's why I'm home from school.

56
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:57,309
I was at the hospital this morning

57
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,313
and, coming home through
the field behind Vista,

58
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,399
I, uh... found an ear.

59
00:08:05,026 --> 00:08:07,736
You did? A human ear?

60
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:10,071
Yeah. I thought
I should bring it to you.

61
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,200
Yeah, that's right.
Let's take a look at it.

62
00:08:18,122 --> 00:08:20,624
Yes, that's a human ear, all right.

63
00:08:21,542 --> 00:08:24,044
Let's see what the coroner makes of it.

64
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,922
Then I want you to show me
exactly where you found it.

65
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,423
All right.

66
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,180
We'll check the morgue records, but I
don't recall anything minus an ear.

67
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,725
The person may very well
still be alive somewhere.

68
00:08:38,893 --> 00:08:41,102
What can you tell about the person
from the ear?

69
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,605
Once the tests are done, quite a lot.

70
00:08:44,607 --> 00:08:47,901
Sex, blood type,
whether the ear came off a dead person.

71
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,656
Also, it looks like
the ear was cut off with scissors.

72
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,064
- I'm goin' out for a while.
- Do you want the car?

73
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,108
- No, I'm just gonna walk around.
- All right.

74
00:09:28,276 --> 00:09:30,652
You're not going down by Lincoln, are you?

75
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,863
No, just around the neighborhood.
Don't worry.

76
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:36,449
OK, honey.

77

(rumbling continues)

82
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:54,194
Hello. My name is Jeffrey Beaumont.
Is Detective Williams here?

83
00:10:54,362 --> 00:10:58,073
- Oh, yes. Yes, Jeffrey, come on in.
- Thanks.

84
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:08,416
(Williams) Well, Jeffrey, you found
something very interesting.

85
00:11:08,584 --> 00:11:12,128
Very interesting. I know you must
be curious to know more.

86
00:11:13,255 --> 00:11:17,175
But I have to ask you not only
not to tell anybody about your find,

87
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,928
but also not to ask more about the case.

88
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,473
One day when it's all sewed up,

89
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,433
I'll let you know all the details.

90
00:11:25,601 --> 00:11:27,727
Right now, though, I can't.

91
00:11:27,895 --> 00:11:32,273
I understand.
I'm just real curious, like you said.

92
00:11:33,442 --> 00:11:35,944
I was the same way myself when I was your age.

93
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:41,116
- That's what got me into this business.
- Must be great.

94
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,993
It's horrible, too.

95
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:48,039
I'm sorry, Jeffrey.
That's the way it has to be.

96
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:51,835
Anyway, I know you do understand.

97
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:53,461
Sure.

98
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:00,969
- Thanks for the card for Dad.
- You're welcome. Nice to meet you.

99
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,554
You, too.

100
00:12:06,642 --> 00:12:08,727
- Say hello to Sandy for me.
- We will.

101
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,981
- Good night, Jeffrey.
- Good night.

102
00:12:13,441 --> 00:12:15,525
(crickets)

103
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,371
(woman)
Are you the one that found the ear?

104
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,184
How did you know?

105
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:55,899
I just know, that's all.

106
00:12:57,193 --> 00:13:00,612
- I remember you from Central.
- Are you a senior?

107
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,696
Yup.

108
00:13:01,864 --> 00:13:04,365
- How is Central these days?
- Terrible.

109
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,827
- I don't know... boring.
- What else is new!

110
00:13:07,995 --> 00:13:09,537
So what are you doin' now?

111
00:13:09,705 --> 00:13:12,207
I'm home from school.
My father's in the hospital.

112
00:13:12,374 --> 00:13:14,542
- That's too bad.
- Yeah.

113
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,920
What do you know about the ear?

114
00:13:17,087 --> 00:13:20,632
- Didn't Dad say not to talk about it?
- Yeah, but you brought it up.

115
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,133
You know anything?

116
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:26,137
I don't know much but bits
and pieces. I hear things.

117
00:13:26,305 --> 00:13:27,889
Yeah?

118
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,225
My room is above my father's office so...

119
00:13:30,392 --> 00:13:32,393
Above your father's office?

120
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,980
- So I heard a few things about the ear.
- Uh-huh. And?

121
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:40,235
Well... there are a couple of cases
I get mixed up on.

122
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:43,238
But one name that keeps coming up
is this woman singer.

123
00:13:43,405 --> 00:13:46,741
She lives in an apartment
real close to your house.

124
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,244
Close to the field where you found the ear.

125
00:13:49,411 --> 00:13:52,205
(Jeffrey)
It's a strange world, isn't it?

126
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:55,291
- Yeah.
- Where is this apartment?

127
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:58,086
It's really close by.
That's what's so creepy.

128
00:13:58,254 --> 00:14:00,088
They had her under surveillance,

129
00:14:00,256 --> 00:14:04,509
'cept I don't know what they found out
'cause she's not my dad's case. So...

130
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,638
I guess you gotta get
back home pretty soon, huh?

131
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,682
Not really. Why?

132
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:12,725
Well, uh...

133
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:16,020
- You... wanna see the building.
- Yeah.

134
00:14:16,605 --> 00:14:18,815
- Come on, I'll show you.
- OK.

135
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,612
Hey, baby! Hey, babe!

136
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:29,325
That's her building right there.

137
00:14:29,952 --> 00:14:32,453
She lives on the seventh floor.

138
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:41,087
Come on.

139
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,188
So, uh... what are you gonna do
now that you're home?

140
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:02,317
Help out at my father's hardware store.

141
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:05,028
They're giving me my own hours, which is nice.

142
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:10,742
I used to know a kid that lived there.

143
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:13,536
Had the biggest tongue in the world.

144
00:15:15,831 --> 00:15:17,624
What happened to him?

145
00:15:19,001 --> 00:15:22,086
I don't know. He moved away.

146
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,088
All my old friends are gone.

147
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:33,848
- You know the chicken walk?
- What's that?

148
00:15:36,143 --> 00:15:38,478
(Sandy laughs)

149
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,522
That's kind of interesting.

150
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,250
(tapping)

151
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,962
- (man) Coffee time.
- (Jeffrey) Yo!

152
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:07,340
Hey, Double Ed, where are the overalls?

153
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:12,220
They're on the bottom shelf, rolled up,
where they've always been.

154
00:16:12,846 --> 00:16:14,722
Hey, Ed, how many fingers?

155
00:16:15,933 --> 00:16:17,225
Four.

156
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,728
I still don't know how you do that.

157
00:16:21,563 --> 00:16:25,066
Now listen. You sure you don't
need me or this rig for a while?

158
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:29,070
If you wanna spray for bugs,
Jeffrey, it causes us no pain.

159
00:16:29,238 --> 00:16:31,114
Okey-dokey, Double Ed.

160
00:16:31,782 --> 00:16:34,575
- Oh, it's so good to have you back.
- Yeah, sure.

161
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,683
You hungry or thirsty, or both?

162
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,352
I don't know.

163
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,563
I'd like to talk to you about somethin'.

164
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:06,357
Wait just a minute.

165
00:17:07,943 --> 00:17:10,945
Listen. Don't you guys
dare say anything to Mike.

166
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,781
- Sure.
- It's not what you think, OK?

167
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,284
- Promise?
- Whatever you say.

168
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:23,124
- I don't wanna cause trouble.
- I'm here, aren't I?

169
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,543
- He is nice-lookin'.
- Yeah.

170
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,966
You ever been to Arlene's?

171
00:17:32,885 --> 00:17:34,385
Of course.

172
00:17:47,649 --> 00:17:49,650
Now are you gonna tell me why we're here?

173
00:17:55,574 --> 00:18:00,119
There are opportunities in life
for gaining knowledge and experience.

174
00:18:01,288 --> 00:18:04,082
Sometimes it's necessary to take a risk.

175
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:09,796
I'll bet someone could learn a lot
by getting into that woman's apartment.

176
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:12,757
You know, sneak in, hide, and observe.

177
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:16,344
- Sneak into her apartment?
- Yeah.

178
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,554
Are you crazy?

179
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:23,226
Jeffrey, she's possibly involved in
murder. This is givin' me the creeps.

180
00:18:23,393 --> 00:18:27,146
Now just settle down.
I have a plan which I think will work.

181
00:18:27,314 --> 00:18:30,191
There's very little for you to do,
but I do need your help.

182
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:33,277
Don't you even wanna hear the plan?

183
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:38,616
Tell me any plan you want, but it's not
going any further than this diner.

184
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:41,119
Sandy,

185
00:18:41,286 --> 00:18:43,204
don't take that attitude.

186
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,669
All right. The first thing I need
is to get into her apartment

187
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:53,673
- and open a window to crawl into later.
- How are you gonna do that?

188
00:18:53,841 --> 00:18:56,926
Right out in the car
I happen to have some old overalls

189
00:18:57,094 --> 00:18:58,553
and a bug-spraying rig.

190
00:18:59,555 --> 00:19:02,140
I will go to her apartment
as a pest-control man.

191
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:03,975
I will spray her apartment.

192
00:19:04,726 --> 00:19:07,854
You knock on the door, draw her
attention away from me,

193
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:09,814
and I'll jimmy a window.

194
00:19:10,774 --> 00:19:14,902
- And what do I say to her at the door?
- You will be a Jehovah's Witness.

195
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:17,613
I have some Awake! magazines for you.

196
00:19:19,116 --> 00:19:23,327
I don't need very much time,
just a few seconds. Whaddaya think?

197
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:26,164
I don't know.

198
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:31,836
I mean, it sounds like a good daydream,
but... actually doing it's too weird.

199
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:37,425
- It's too dangerous.
- Sandy, let's just try the first part.

200
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,556
No one will suspect us.

201
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:47,602
No one would think two people like us
would be crazy enough to do this.

202
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,647
You have a point there.

203
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,287
Give me at least three minutes.

204
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:10,291
I can stall if it's more, but I need
time to find a good window. All right?

205
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,127
All right.

206
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:15,213
Let's go.

207
00:20:28,143 --> 00:20:29,477
Here I go.

208
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,855
Wait a minute. What's her name?

209
00:20:33,023 --> 00:20:35,149
Oh, brother, Jeffrey.

210
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:38,402
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

211
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:42,490
Look on her mailbox for the number, bright boy.

212
00:20:44,576 --> 00:20:45,826
Thanks.

213
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,996
Dorothy Vallens, seventh floor.

214
00:20:50,249 --> 00:20:53,167
OK. Good luck.

215
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:55,419
Good luck yourself.

216
00:20:56,838 --> 00:20:59,131
Three minutes. No sooner.

217
00:21:12,604 --> 00:21:15,273
(electrical arcing)

218
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,525
(water dripping)

219
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:48,532
Yes? What is it?

220
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:50,785
Pest control. I gotta do your apartment.

221
00:22:54,122 --> 00:22:58,292
- That stuff stinks.
- This is new stuff. There's no smell.

222
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,794
Good.

223
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,934
Just need to do the kitchen.

224
00:23:40,335 --> 00:23:42,420
(knock at door)

225
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,880
Grand Central Station!

226
00:23:57,686 --> 00:24:00,688
- (spraying)
- It's only the bug man.

227
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:30,593
- That should do it.
- Yeah?

228
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:40,603
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. What happened?

229
00:24:40,770 --> 00:24:43,856
I was about to go to the door
when that guy did it for me.

230
00:24:44,024 --> 00:24:46,901
- Was it all right?
- Yes and no. Did you recognize him?

231
00:24:47,068 --> 00:24:51,071
I only saw his back. I think he went out
a door at the end of the hall.

232
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,158
I didn't get a good look at him either,
but he sure looked at me.

233
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:58,746
I didn't have time to get a window,
but I found these keys. Nifty, huh?

234
00:24:58,914 --> 00:25:00,998
Yeah, if they open the door.

235
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:02,583
Yeah.

236
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,143
So, what's next?

237
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,232
- Are you game for more?
- I owe you one

238
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:28,275
since I goofed this one up.

239
00:25:28,443 --> 00:25:32,321
You didn't goof it up.
But... you still owe me one.

240
00:25:38,161 --> 00:25:39,787
I'm gonna try and sneak in tonight.

241
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:44,291
It's Friday. Do you have a date?

242
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,587
Yeah. I do.

243
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:57,805
Well, that does that.

244
00:26:12,070 --> 00:26:16,073
- You really wanna do this, don't you?
- I don't want you to get involved.

245
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,867
I do, but if something went wrong...

246
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:21,203
Like you said, they may be involved in murder.

247
00:26:27,836 --> 00:26:30,504
OK. I'll tell Mike I'm sick.

248
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:35,092
Just so the record is kept straight, though,

249
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,344
I love Mike.

250
00:26:40,015 --> 00:26:42,016
What do you want me to do?

251
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,022
First we'll have a really nice dinner.

252
00:26:48,189 --> 00:26:50,399
Try to find out where Dorothy Vallens sings.

253
00:26:50,567 --> 00:26:53,527
I already know.
The Slow Club on Route 7.

254
00:26:53,695 --> 00:26:55,821
Great. I'll pick you up about eight?

255
00:26:55,989 --> 00:26:59,074
Don't pick me up.
My dad might think it's strange.

256
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:03,579
I'll walk over to your house.
I'll be there at eight o'clock. OK?

257
00:27:03,747 --> 00:27:06,081
You better get out before someone sees us.

258
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,841
See ya!

259
00:27:42,077 --> 00:27:46,455
Wait. Here's to an interesting
experience, huh?

260
00:27:46,623 --> 00:27:48,248
I'll drink to that!

261
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,383
Man, I like Heineken!
You like Heineken?

262
00:27:58,176 --> 00:28:02,554
- I never really had Heineken before.
- You never had Heineken before?

263
00:28:02,722 --> 00:28:04,598
My dad drinks Bud.

264
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:09,687
- King of beers.
- (MC) Ladies and gentlemen,

265
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:14,024

00:28:25,787 --> 00:28:27,871

- Jeffrey, you shouldn't do this.
- Why not?

279
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:24,029
'Cause it's crazy... and dangerous.

280
00:30:24,656 --> 00:30:27,741
- My God, I should have never told you.
- I'll be all right.

281
00:30:28,034 --> 00:30:30,744
I don't think you should stay.
I think you should go home.

282
00:30:30,912 --> 00:30:32,412
Can you drive this car?

283
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:35,666
- Yeah, but I...
- Leave it in front of your house, OK?

284
00:30:37,335 --> 00:30:38,252
OK.

285
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:41,505
I'll see ya tomorrow
and I'll tell ya how it went.

286
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,842
I don't wanna see you tomorrow.

287
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:49,680
- Mike's coming over.
- OK. Um... can I call you?

288
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,308
OK, yeah, call.

289
00:30:54,018 --> 00:30:55,811
I hope you sneak out OK.

290
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:03,443
- I'm gonna wait here until she comes.
- Sandy...

291
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:05,779
I'm gonna honk four times.

292
00:31:05,947 --> 00:31:10,951
I'll go one, two, three, four,
and then you'll hear it

293
00:31:11,119 --> 00:31:14,037
- and you'll know she's on her way up.
- OK.

294
00:31:17,625 --> 00:31:20,002
I don't know if you're
a detective or a pervert.

295
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,590
Well, that's for me to know
and you to find out.

296
00:31:40,106 --> 00:31:41,106
See ya.

297
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,858
Bye.

298
00:34:02,749 --> 00:34:04,708
(urinates)

299
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:06,376
Heineken.

300
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,805

301
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:21,016
(loud flushing)

302
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,653
I hope you're OK, Jeffrey.

303
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,000
(sound of key in lock)

304
00:34:53,674 --> 00:34:55,634
(Dorothy) Thank you, Jimmy.
See you tomorrow.

305
00:34:55,802 --> 00:34:57,302
- OK, good night.
- Good night.

306
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,286
(phone rings)

307
00:35:25,873 --> 00:35:31,545
Hello? Yes, sir. Frank?
Frank, let me talk to him.

308
00:35:31,712 --> 00:35:34,381
Please, Frank... sir.

309
00:35:37,635 --> 00:35:39,219
I like to sing "Blue Velvet".

310
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,266
Don... Don, it's all right, don't worry.

311
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:47,519
Don! Don, can you hear me?

312
00:35:48,187 --> 00:35:49,813
Is little Donny all right?

313
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:53,567
Is he there with you?

314
00:35:56,237 --> 00:35:57,404
Don?

315
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:05,996
You mean Meadow Lane? Frank!
Frank, what's the matter with him?

316
00:36:08,249 --> 00:36:10,834
I know. I'll be sweet.

317
00:36:13,337 --> 00:36:14,754
Mommy loves you.

318
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:19,259
OK, Frank... sir.

319
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:51,625
(whimpers)

320
00:37:53,437 --> 00:37:56,147
(coat hanger falls down)

321
00:38:28,055 --> 00:38:30,015
Get out of there! Get out!

322
00:38:30,683 --> 00:38:33,393
Put your hands up! On your head! Do it!

323
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:36,604
Get on your knees! Do it!

324
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,523
What are you doing?

325
00:38:39,233 --> 00:38:42,902
- Who are you? What's your name?
- Jeffrey.

326
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:45,363
- Jeffrey what?
- Jeffrey nothing.

327
00:38:47,658 --> 00:38:50,160
Give me your wallet.
Give me your wallet!

328
00:38:57,251 --> 00:39:01,171
Jeffrey Beaumont. What are you doing
in my apartment, Jeffrey Beaumont?

329
00:39:02,006 --> 00:39:04,841
- I wanted to see you.
- Are you kidding?

330
00:39:05,593 --> 00:39:07,594
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.

331
00:39:07,762 --> 00:39:11,348
- I've seen you before.
- I sprayed your apartment.

332
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:14,601
I took your key. I didn't mean
to do anything except see you.

333
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:17,937
What did you see, tonight?

334
00:39:18,105 --> 00:39:19,939
Tell me!

335
00:39:20,107 --> 00:39:22,108
I saw you come in, talk on the phone...

336
00:39:22,276 --> 00:39:25,153
- And then?
- You got undressed.

337
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:30,450
Do you sneak in girls' apartments
to see them get undressed?

338
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,036
No, never before this.

339
00:39:33,204 --> 00:39:38,333
- Get undressed. I want to see you.
- Look, I'm sorry. Just let me leave.

340
00:39:38,501 --> 00:39:41,211
No way! I want to see you!
Get undressed!

341
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:00,688
Stand up.

342
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,413
Come closer.

343
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:27,924
Closer.

344
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:38,476
What do you want?

345
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:42,272
I don't know.

346
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:50,155
(Jeffrey gasps)

347
00:40:56,370 --> 00:40:59,581
Don't move. Don't look at me.

348
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,970
- Do you like that?
- Yes.

349
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:19,058
Don't touch me! Or I'll kill you!

350
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:22,562
Do you like talk like that?

351
00:41:24,148 --> 00:41:25,148
No.

352
00:41:28,110 --> 00:41:29,819
Get over there on that couch.

353
00:41:35,868 --> 00:41:37,285
Lie down.

354
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,094
(knock at door)

355
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,057
Shut up! Don't say anything.
Hide in the closet.

356
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:02,393
Don't say anything, or I'll kill you.
I mean it.

357
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,618
(banging on front door)

358
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,594
- Hello, baby.
- Shut up!

359
00:42:36,762 --> 00:42:39,639
It's Daddy, you shithead!
Where's my bourbon?

360
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:45,812
Can't you fuckin' remember anything?

361
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,327
Now it's dark.

362
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:05,540
(sighs)

363
00:43:09,837 --> 00:43:11,379
Spread your legs.

364
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:24,058
Wider.

365
00:43:27,146 --> 00:43:28,646
Now show it to me.

366
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:51,044
Don't you fuckin' look at me.

367
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,973
(hissing sound)

368
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,783
Mommy...

369
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,663
(moans)

370
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:33,211
Mommy! Mommy!

371
00:44:33,921 --> 00:44:36,756
- Mommy...
- Mommy loves you, Frank.

372
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,967
(whines) Baby wants to fuck!

373
00:44:42,429 --> 00:44:46,766
(shouts) All right, get ready to fuck!
You fucker's fucker! You fucker!

374
00:44:49,436 --> 00:44:51,604
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

375
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:11,207
Baby... wants blue velvet.

376
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:13,459
(grizzles)

377
00:45:31,311 --> 00:45:32,937
(growls)

378
00:45:33,981 --> 00:45:37,567
Don't you fuckin' look at me!
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

379
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:46,075
- Look at me. Daddy's coming home.
- (Dorothy sobs)

380
00:45:49,288 --> 00:45:50,747
Daddy's comin' home.

381
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:53,082
(Dorothy moans)

382
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:55,376
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

383
00:45:58,839 --> 00:46:00,715
Daddy's comin' home.

384
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,846
(muffled) Daddy's comin' home.

385
00:46:08,682 --> 00:46:10,475
Daddy's coming home.

386
00:46:10,642 --> 00:46:13,186
Daddy's coming home.

387
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:15,188
Daddy's coming...

388
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:18,524
Mommy! Mommy!

389
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,569
(Frank yowls)

390
00:46:26,283 --> 00:46:29,243
(Frank grunts)

391
00:46:37,544 --> 00:46:39,253
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

392
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,049
Don't you fuckin' look at me!

393
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,429
(Frank whines)

394
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:03,236
Now it's dark.

395
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,877
You stay alive, baby.

396
00:47:22,339 --> 00:47:24,215
Do it for Van Gogh.

397
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:35,977
(front door closes)

398
00:47:55,080 --> 00:47:57,164
(Dorothy gasps)

399
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:00,626
Why don't you lie down?

400
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:04,005
Come on, I'll help you.

401
00:48:09,177 --> 00:48:11,262
(Dorothy sobs)

402
00:48:14,141 --> 00:48:15,725
I don't like that.

403
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:17,685
What do you want?

404
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:19,729
Nothing.

405
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,690
Are you all right?

406
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:27,987
Yeah, I'm all right.

407
00:48:31,033 --> 00:48:32,491
I'm all right.

408
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,076
I'll go, then.

409
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:37,330
Don?

410
00:48:37,831 --> 00:48:39,332
- Oh, Don!
- No...

411
00:48:39,499 --> 00:48:42,668
Oh, Don, hold me. Hold me.

412
00:48:43,337 --> 00:48:46,339
I'm scared. I'm scared.

413
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,591
I'm scared!

414
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:51,636
It's OK. It's OK.

415
00:48:51,803 --> 00:48:54,555
Don? Don?

416
00:48:56,808 --> 00:48:58,476
Are you back?

417
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:10,404
Do you like me?

418
00:49:14,826 --> 00:49:17,119
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

419
00:49:26,338 --> 00:49:28,089
Do you like the way I feel?

420
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,216
Yes.

421
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,600
See my breast?

422
00:49:42,896 --> 00:49:44,563
You can feel it.

423
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:51,696
My nipple is getting hard.

424
00:49:53,532 --> 00:49:55,199
You can touch it.

425
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,790
You can feel it.

426
00:50:05,127 --> 00:50:06,836
Do you like the way I feel?

427
00:50:08,922 --> 00:50:10,256
Yes.

428
00:50:13,010 --> 00:50:14,593
Feel me.

429
00:50:19,683 --> 00:50:20,683
Hit me.

430
00:50:23,103 --> 00:50:25,479
- Dorothy, no. Stop it.
- Hit me.

431
00:50:26,189 --> 00:50:27,356
Hit me.

432
00:50:28,025 --> 00:50:29,233
Hit me!

433
00:51:08,023 --> 00:51:09,398
I'm leaving now.

434
00:51:11,485 --> 00:51:13,152
(Dorothy) Don.

435
00:51:15,655 --> 00:51:17,156
Don.

436
00:51:19,826 --> 00:51:21,243
Help me.

437
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:48,312
Oh, my God. That hat.

438
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,608
She's married.

439
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:54,652
"Don."

440
00:52:04,204 --> 00:52:05,454
(Dorothy whispers) Help me.

441
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,887
(humming sound)

442
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:33,482
(humming gets louder)

443
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:37,236
(distorted speech)

444
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,916
(Frank) Now it's dark.

445
00:52:51,585 --> 00:52:54,086
Hit me. Hit me.

446
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,672
(Dorothy screams)

447
00:53:03,096 --> 00:53:04,722
Man, oh man.

448
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,564
- Sandy, can ya talk?
- Mike's here.

449
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:16,817
Oh. I guess I'll talk to you later,
then.

450
00:53:16,985 --> 00:53:20,696
- Well, how'd it go?
- It went OK. I'll tell you about it.

451
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,198
I'll pick you up at eight.

452
00:53:22,365 --> 00:53:26,452
New axe, 48721.

453
00:53:27,329 --> 00:53:29,413
Twenty-two...

454
00:53:29,956 --> 00:53:32,166
...ninety-five.

455
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:36,503
- I'll see ya then.
- OK, great.

456
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:38,255
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

457
00:54:16,336 --> 00:54:17,461
Well?

458
00:54:18,838 --> 00:54:20,714
Aren't you gonna tell me about it?

459
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:24,218
OK.

460
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:31,558
It's a strange world, Sandy.

461
00:54:37,482 --> 00:54:40,859
Dorothy Vallens is married, to a man named Don.

462
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:43,487
They have a son.

463
00:54:45,699 --> 00:54:49,994
I think the son and the husband have
been kidnapped by a man named Frank.

464
00:54:50,161 --> 00:54:54,290
Frank has done this
to force Dorothy to do things for him.

465
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:57,459
I think she wants to die.

466
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:03,257
I think Frank cut the ear I found
off her husband

467
00:55:03,425 --> 00:55:05,217
as a warning for her to stay alive.

468
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,722
Frank is, uh...

469
00:55:12,809 --> 00:55:14,727
...a very dangerous man.

470
00:55:16,187 --> 00:55:17,771
(whispers) My God.

471
00:55:19,774 --> 00:55:23,527
- Shouldn't you tell my father?
- No. I can't do that.

472
00:55:24,738 --> 00:55:28,907
I can't prove any of this.
I found out my information illegally.

473
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:30,576
You could get into a lot of trouble.

474
00:55:33,413 --> 00:55:34,997
You saw all that in one night?

475
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,669
It is a strange world.

476
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,137
Why are there people like Frank?

477
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,057
Why is there so much trouble in this world?

478
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,602
I don't know.

479
00:56:02,525 --> 00:56:03,984
I had a dream.

480
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,574
In fact, it was the night I met you.

481
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:21,418
In the dream, there was our world,

482
00:56:22,504 --> 00:56:26,215
and the world was dark
because there weren't any robins.

483
00:56:26,383 --> 00:56:29,176
And the robins represented love.

484
00:56:32,472 --> 00:56:36,892
And for the longest time
there was just this darkness.

485
00:56:38,144 --> 00:56:39,895
And all of a sudden

486
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:43,232
thousands of robins were set free.

487
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:47,903
And they flew down and
brought this blinding light of love.

488
00:56:49,989 --> 00:56:52,658
And it seemed like that love

489
00:56:53,576 --> 00:56:56,829
would be the only thing
that would make any difference,

490
00:56:58,706 --> 00:57:00,249
and it did.

491
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,677
So I guess it means...

492
00:57:13,638 --> 00:57:15,973
...there is trouble
till the robins come.

493
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:20,602
You're a neat girl.

494
00:57:21,771 --> 00:57:22,896

495
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:26,316
I mean... you're a neat guy.

496
00:57:36,202 --> 00:57:38,871
I guess we better go.

497
00:57:40,373 --> 00:57:42,583
Yeah. I guess so.

498

499

They went to a factory, stood on a
staircase and looked into the distance.

Now get this. In the distance,
there was a murder.

Ooh, ooh, give 'em back.

They're just a little red, that's all.

This is the first picture.

899
01:31:38,326 --> 01:31:39,367
It's Frank Booth.

900
01:31:41,245 --> 01:31:44,080
He is a very sick and dangerous man.

901
01:31:45,082 --> 01:31:47,250
His address is on the back of the photo.

902
01:31:49,337 --> 01:31:52,923
This photo is of Frank and another man
as they went into Frank's building.

903
01:32:11,484 --> 01:32:16,613
And then that man came out and met
with a third man. This well-dressed guy.

904
01:32:16,781 --> 01:32:18,198
Here's that photo.

905
01:32:23,412 --> 01:32:26,498
I think a woman named Dorothy Vallens
is in trouble with these people.

906
01:32:27,959 --> 01:32:32,003
I think Frank kidnapped her husband
and son. I have no hard proof of this.

- Is Sandy part of this?

Who else knows you have these photos?

909

Just you and the photo lab.

910
01:32:47,812 --> 01:32:51,022
- And you're through with this now?
- Yes, sir, I am.

911
01:32:54,819 --> 01:32:59,656
For now, all right, you better be. And
Sandy better not be involved with this.

Be prepared to come in
