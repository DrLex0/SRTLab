Well, I'm looking for a change.

53

Our people in Denver recommended
Jack very highly, and for once...

54

...that our season here runs from
May 1 5th to October 30th.

Then we close down completely

Do you mind if l ask why you do that?

lt seems to me that the skiing
up here would be fantastic.

61
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:15,457
lt would be. The problem is
the enormous cost...

62
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:18,210
...it would be to keep
the road to Sidewinder open.

lt's a 25-mile stretch of road.

lt gets 20 feet of snow
during the winter.

There's just no way to make it

67

When the place was built in 1 907...

68

...there was very little interest
in winter sports.

This site was chosen for its
seclusion and scenic beauty.

That's right.

73
00:06:47,031 --> 00:06:48,698
...about what the job entails?

74
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,992
Only in a very general way.

00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,245
Well...

...the winters can be fantastically cruel.

77
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:59,751
The basic idea is to cope
with the very costly damage...

78
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:01,962
...and depreciation
which can occur.

79
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,589
This consists mainly
of running the boiler...

80
00:07:04,799 --> 00:07:08,760
...heating different parts of the
hotel on a daily rotating basis...

81

...repairing damage as it occurs...

82
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:14,683
...and doing repairs so the
elements can't get a foothold.

83

That sounds fine to me.

Physically, it's not
a very demanding job.

85
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:24,734
The only thing that can get a bit
trying here during the winter...

86
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,571
...is a tremendous sense
of isolation.

My predecessor in this job...

00:08:37,433 --> 00:08:40,477
...hired a man named Charles Grady
as the winter caretaker.

111
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:44,231
He came up with his wife and
two little girls of about 8 and 1 0.

112
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:47,442
He had a good employment record,
good references.

113
00:08:47,610 --> 00:08:49,903
And from what l've been told,
he seemed...

114
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,781
...like a completely
normal individual.

115
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,367
But at some point during the winter...

116
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,204
...he must have suffered some kind
of a complete mental breakdown.

117
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:01,790
He ran amuck...

118
00:09:05,169 --> 00:09:07,379
...and killed his family
with an ax.

119

Stacked them neatly in a room
in the west wing, and then...

120

...he put both barrels
of his shotgun in his mouth.

121
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,809
The police thought...

122

used to call cabin fever.

00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,147
DOCTOR: Now, hold your eyes still
so l can see.

162
00:12:16,652 --> 00:12:18,862
That's good. Now the other one.

163
00:12:20,281 --> 00:12:21,740
Good boy.

164
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,457
Now, Danny...

165
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,959
...when you were brushing
your teeth...

166
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:36,171
...do you remember if you
smelled anything funny...

167
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:41,134
...or saw any bright, flashing
lights or anything at all strange?

168
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,138
No.

169
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,683
DOCTOR: Do you remember
when you were brushing your teeth?

170
00:12:49,268 --> 00:12:50,560
Yes.

171
00:12:51,687 --> 00:12:55,356
What's the next thing you remember
after you were brushing your teeth?

172
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:03,698
My mom was saying, "Wake up.
Wake up, Danny, wake up."

173
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,620
Now, Danny, can you remember
what you were doing...

174
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:11,748
...just before you started
brushing your teeth?

175
00:13:14,251 --> 00:13:16,044
Talking to Tony.

176
00:13:16,712 --> 00:13:19,047
ls Tony one of your animals?

177
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,884
No. He's a little boy
that lives in my mouth.

178
00:13:23,177 --> 00:13:25,553
Tony's his imaginary friend.

179
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,388
DOCTOR:
Oh.

180
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:31,893
lf you were to open your mouth now,
could l see Tony?

181
00:13:32,686 --> 00:13:34,103
No.

182
00:13:34,563 --> 00:13:35,814
Why not?

183
00:13:37,066 --> 00:13:38,900
Because he hides.

184
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,319
Where does he go?

185
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:44,239
To my stomach.

186
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,160
Does Tony ever tell you
to do things?

187
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:55,917
l don't want to talk
about Tony anymore.

188
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:58,378
Okay.

189
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,963
That's fine.

190
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:02,549
All right, Danny.

191
00:14:03,342 --> 00:14:06,135
l'm going to ask you
to do me a favor...

192
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:09,722
...and stay quietly in bed
for the rest of the day. Okay?

193
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,057
Do l have to?

194
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:13,518
Yes. l'd like you to.

195
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:16,479
We're going in the other room
for a few minutes and talk.

196
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:19,065
l'll come back and check on you.

197
00:14:19,233 --> 00:14:21,109
-Okay.
-Bye.

198
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:29,742
-Shall we go into the living room?
-Yes.

199
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:35,290
-Please.
-Thank you.

200
00:14:39,169 --> 00:14:43,548
Mrs. Torrance, I don't think
you have anything to worry about.

201
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,802
l'm quite sure there's nothing
physically wrong with Danny.

202
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:49,971
Yeah?

203
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,973
Oh.

204
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:55,643
He seems absolutely fine now.

205
00:14:55,853 --> 00:14:56,853
But you should've seen him.

206
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:58,563
l know.

207
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:00,481
Kids can scare you to death.

208
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:03,526
But believe me, these episodes
are not at all uncommon.

209
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:06,321
And they look much worse
than they are.

210
00:15:06,822 --> 00:15:09,490
But what was the matter with him?

211
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:13,828
Most of the time, these episodes
with kids are never explained.

212
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:18,875
They're brought on by emotional
factors and rarely occur again.

213
00:15:19,668 --> 00:15:22,670
They're more akin
to autohypnosis...

214
00:15:22,838 --> 00:15:25,840
...a kind of self-induced trance.

215
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:28,009
lf it reoccurs, which l doubt...

216
00:15:28,886 --> 00:15:32,013
...we can always think about
having some tests done.

217
00:15:32,473 --> 00:15:33,932
No, thank you.

218
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,851
l'm sure you're right.

219
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,189
Have you been in Boulder long?

220
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:43,316
Only about three months.

221
00:15:43,525 --> 00:15:46,861
We're from Vermont. My husband
was teaching school there.

222
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:52,700
Did the appearance
of Danny's imaginary friend....

223
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:53,952
Tony.

224
00:15:54,161 --> 00:15:58,122
Did Tony's first appearance happen
to coincide with your arrival here?

225
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,042
No, um....

226
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,543
Let's see....

227
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,838
l guess Danny started
talking to Tony...

228
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,716
...about the time we put him
in nursery school.

229
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,427
Did he adjust well to school?

230
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,471
No.

231
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:15,556
He didn't like it too much at first.

232
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,060
Then he had an injury, so we kept
him out for a while and....

233
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:24,399
Yeah, l guess that's about when l first
noticed he was talking to Tony.

234
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,777
What sort of injury did he have?

235
00:16:28,445 --> 00:16:30,613
He dislocated his shoulder.

236
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,366
How did he manage to do that?

237
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:39,872
lt was just one of
those things, you know.

238
00:16:40,082 --> 00:16:42,083
Purely an accident.

239
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,837
My husband had been drinking...

240
00:16:46,046 --> 00:16:49,382
...and he came home
about three hours late.

241
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:54,262
So he wasn't exactly
in the greatest mood that night.

242
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:59,767
And Danny had scattered some of his
school papers all over the room...

243
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:04,272
...and my husband grabbed his arm
to pull him away from them.

244
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,525
lt's just the sort of thing you do
1 00 times with a child...

245
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,777
...you know, in a park or in the street.

246
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,489
But on this particular occasion...

247
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,325
...my husband just used
too much strength...

248
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:19,120
...and he injured Danny's arm.

249
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:26,711
Anyway, something good did come out
of it all because he said:

250
00:17:26,962 --> 00:17:29,505
"Wendy, I'm never going to
touch another drop.

251
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:31,632
And if l do, you can leave me."

252
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:33,176
And he didn't.

253
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:37,889
He hasn't had any alcohol in 5 months.

254
00:18:03,165 --> 00:18:04,665
Boy.

255
00:18:04,833 --> 00:18:09,003
We must really be high up.
The air feels so different.

256
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:11,672
Mm-hm.

257
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:15,843
Dad?

258
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:18,012
Yes?

259
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,348
l'm hungry.

260
00:18:22,184 --> 00:18:24,936
You should've eaten your breakfast.

261
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,689
We'll get you something
as soon as we get to the hotel.

262
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,525
Okay, Mom.

263
00:18:31,944 --> 00:18:36,072
Wasn't it around here that
the Donner party got snowbound?

264
00:18:37,825 --> 00:18:41,160
l think that was farther west,
in the Sierras.

265
00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:42,620
Oh.

266
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,206
What was the Donner party?

267
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:51,420
They were a party of settlers
in covered wagon times.

268
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:54,924
They got snowbound one winter
in the mountains.

269
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:59,345
They had to resort to cannibalism
in order to stay alive.

270
00:19:00,472 --> 00:19:03,391
You mean they ate each other up?

271
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:06,686
They had to in order to survive.

272
00:19:06,895 --> 00:19:08,104
Jack.

273
00:19:08,313 --> 00:19:09,397
Don't worry, Mom.

274
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:13,943
l know all about cannibalism.
l saw it on TV.

275
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,779
See, it's okay.

276
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:19,407
He saw it on the television.

277
00:19:50,105 --> 00:19:51,939
-What time does the plane leave?
-8:30.

278
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,942
That gives us plenty of time
to go over everything.

279
00:19:55,110 --> 00:19:57,069
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Bye.

280
00:19:57,279 --> 00:20:00,406
Good morning. l hope you
haven't been waiting too long.

281
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,242
No problem. We had time
to grab a bite to eat.

282
00:20:03,452 --> 00:20:06,329
Good. Glad you made it
before they shut down the kitchen.

283
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:08,289
-Hi.
-Is your family having a look around?

284
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,834
No, my son's
discovered the games room.

285
00:20:12,044 --> 00:20:14,170
-Has your luggage been brought in?
-Right there.

286
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,588
Oh, fine.

287
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:17,673
ln view of all we have to cover today...

288
00:20:17,883 --> 00:20:21,552
...l suggest we have a quick look
at your apartment and get started.

289
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:24,263
Have the Torrances' things
brought to their apartment.

290
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:26,641
-Fine.
-I'd better collect my family first.

291
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,059
Oh, yes.

292
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:37,944
This is our Colorado Lounge.

293
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,571
lt's beautiful.

294
00:20:40,989 --> 00:20:42,823
My God!

295
00:20:43,033 --> 00:20:45,618
This place is fantastic, isn't it, hon?

296
00:20:45,827 --> 00:20:47,161
lt sure is.

297
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,164
l've never seen anything
like this before.

298
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,751
Are all these
lndian designs authentic?

299
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:55,378
l believe they're based...

300
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:58,798
...mainly on Navajo and Apache motifs.

301
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:00,967
They're really gorgeous.

302
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,176
As a matter of fact...

303
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:05,513
...this is probably the most
gorgeous hotel l've ever seen.

304
00:21:05,889 --> 00:21:08,849
This old place has had
an illustrious past.

305
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:12,186
ln its heyday, it was a stopping
place for the jet setters...

306
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,356
...even before anybody knew
what a jet set was.

307
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:18,609
We had four presidents
who stayed here.

308
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,152
Lots of movie stars.

309
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,904
Royalty?

310
00:21:22,281 --> 00:21:23,698
All the best people.

311
00:22:16,793 --> 00:22:19,378
This is the staff wing of the hotel.

312
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:23,674
None of the other bedrooms
are heated during the winter.

313
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,802
-Goodbye, Mr. Ullman.
-Goodbye, girls.

314
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:29,055
ULLMAN:
And here are your quarters.

315
00:22:29,431 --> 00:22:32,058
Living room, bedroom, bathroom.

316
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:34,769
And a small bedroom for your son.

317
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,107
Perfect for a child.

318
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,984
-Yeah.
-Yes.

319
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:51,077
ULLMAN: Well, then. Place is
very nicely self-contained.

320
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:52,828
Easy to keep.

321
00:22:55,624 --> 00:22:56,665
Cozy.

322
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,126
ULLMAN:
Yes, very cozy for a family.

323
00:22:59,378 --> 00:23:01,045
lf you feel like spreading out...

324
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:03,923
...you have the rest of the hotel
to move around in.

325
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:08,052
Well, it's very...

326
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:09,887
...homey.

327
00:23:10,138 --> 00:23:11,263
Yeah.

328
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,059
This is our famous hedge maze.

329
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:19,563
lt's quite an attraction here.
The walls are 1 3 feet high...

330
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:22,066
...and the hedge is as old
as the hotel itself.

331
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,902
A lot of fun, but l wouldn't
want to go in there...

332
00:23:25,112 --> 00:23:28,114
...unless l had an hour
to spare to find my way out.

333
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,617
WENDY:
When was the Overlook built?

334
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,829
Construction started in 1 907.

335
00:23:35,038 --> 00:23:36,997
lt was finished in 1 909.

336
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,875
The site's supposed to be
on an Indian burial ground.

337
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:41,710
They actually had to repel...

338
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,839
...a few Indian attacks as they
were building it.

339
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,341
That's our Snowcat.

340
00:23:48,009 --> 00:23:49,343
Can you both drive a car?

341
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,511
BOTH:
Yes.

342
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:54,181
ULLMAN: That's fine. Basically
the Snowcat operates very much like a car.

343
00:23:54,349 --> 00:23:56,934
lt won't take you long
to get the hang of it.

344
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:01,522
As a matter of fact, we brought
a decorator in from Chicago...

345
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,233
...just last year to refurbish
this part of the hotel.

346
00:24:04,401 --> 00:24:07,027
Oh. He sure did a beautiful job.

347
00:24:07,195 --> 00:24:09,530
Pink and gold are my favorite colors.

348
00:24:10,365 --> 00:24:12,700
Well, this is our Gold Ballroom.

349
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,536
Oh, l'll say!

350
00:24:15,745 --> 00:24:19,540
We can accommodate up to
300 people here very comfortably.

351
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:22,918
Boy, we could really have
a good party in this room.

352
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,922
l'm afraid you won't do too well
here unless you brought supplies.

353
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:30,217
We remove the booze from
the premises when we shut down.

354
00:24:30,385 --> 00:24:33,471
That reduces the insurance
we normally have to carry.

355
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:34,638
We don't drink.

356
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:36,265
Then you're in luck.

357
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:40,728
Dick, come on over and say hello
to Mr. and Mrs. Torrance.

358
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:43,063
This is Dick Hallorann,
our head chef.

359
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:45,983
Mr. Hallorann, l'm Jack.
This is my wife, Winifred.

The Torrances will take care
of the Overlook this winter.

362

That's just great. How do you
folks like our hotel so far?

Dan, did you get tired
of bombing the universe?

Yeah.

This is it.

How do you like it, Danny?
ls it big enough for you?

382
00:25:42,165 --> 00:25:45,501
Yeah. lt's the biggest place l ever seen.

383

This whole place
is such an enormous maze.

what to do with it if l did.

One thing for sure, you don't
have to worry about food.

390

-Yeah.

l guess l probably
heard you call him that.

lt's possible.
But l honestly don't remember...

...calling him that
since we've been with you.

Hi, how are you folks

But our telephones

Are the lines down,
by any chance? Over.

Yes, quite a few of them are down
due to the storm. Over.

Any chance of them
