1
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:55,294
No, I ain't, Mrs. Torrance.

2
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:12,147
Now, hold your eyes still
so I can see.

3
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:31,617
When was the Overlook built?

4
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:50,511
Yes.

5
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:22,340
- Oh, no!
- Keep America clean.

6
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,436
I won't, Mom.

7
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:34,191
...because I'm going to
make lunch soon.

8
00:52:35,068 --> 00:52:37,820
-Okay?
- Okay, Mom.

9
01:16:39,177 --> 01:16:43,014
We're sorry.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.

10
01:16:43,114 --> 01:16:49,077
This is a poorly made subtitle.
Subtitles should not have more than 2 lines,
but fixing this automatically is very hard.

11
01:16:49,177 --> 01:16:53,014
- Let's see if this awful regex
also works with 2 people in the same subtitle.
- Yeah, let's!

12
01:16:53,177 --> 01:16:55,014
This tool has
one purpose, and one purpose only:

13
01:16:55,114 --> 01:16:57,114
To obliterate crappy SRT files.
