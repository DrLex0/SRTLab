This is a simple file that almost looks like ASCII

2
00:00:27,183 --> 00:00:31,416
However, somewhere down below I'll sneak in
some accents that sometimes occur in English

3
00:01:27,183 --> 00:01:31,416
Blah blah

4
00:02:27,183 --> 00:02:31,416
Nothing to see here

5
00:03:27,183 --> 00:03:31,416
I got a bad feeling about this

6
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:31,416
What good is a phone call
if your mouth has been filled with CGI

7
00:05:27,183 --> 00:05:31,416
It is time to kick ass and chew bubble gum
And I'm all out of ass

00:06:27,183 --> 00:06:31,416
[CHEWING SOUNDS]

9
00:07:27,183 --> 00:07:31,416
Here it comes

10
00:08:27,183 --> 00:08:31,416
I got a serious case of déjà vu here

11
00:09:27,183 --> 00:09:31,416
Boy, wasn't that exciting

11
00:10:27,183 --> 00:10:31,416
That's all folks!
